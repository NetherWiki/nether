## The Standard Framework
Skyshale uses the term 'self-assembling' to describe the way splinter Prototheist groups grow and merge back together.

# Characters
## Kenrick Valler
This guy is a half-black half-Mexican student journalist who wanted to interview Skyshale and got wrapped up in her weird world like so many others.
He later started CDF and the reason CDF is so into hacking culture is because Skyshale got him into hacking as a hobby, and then he joined up with the Cult of Dead Cow, which is why he named his collective the Cult of the Dead Fox after Skyshale died (her fursona was a fox).

Perhaps he's the one who originally dumped the docs to /x/ to prevent Vanilla from controlling access to them.

## Tsukitei Endo
Endo is the deadname of the transgender CEO of Vanilla Corporation.
She was a Japanese salaryman who hated his job and his family.
She met Skyshale online, realized she was transgender, and left her wife and kids to move to America and marry Skyshale and live her life as a woman, even though she barely spoke English.
She became one of Skyshale's most devoted disciples.

We may include this as a quote: A lot of people outside of Vanilla believe she gained her role as CEO of Vanilla because she founded it, or for some SJW reasoning regarding her being transgender.
This is incorrect.
She's had many wannabe usurpers over the years and she's always faced them down.
She's CEO because she's smart and ruthless.
She takes no income.

## Skyshale
We want to imply a narrative that although she claims her life's work is about eliminating craving and aversion, she was an addict before she got into meditation and perhaps she's just trading one addiction for another.

### Suicide
I like the idea that she died through self-immolation, similar to [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c), who she was obsessed with.
In her suicide note (the first two pages of the Black Notebook) she states that she wanted to tell her friends not to feel bad for her, that she was happy, but concepts like happiness and sadness don't mean much to her anymore.
However she is at peace.
(Am I ripping this off from something?)

I was thinking she could light herself in flames right in front of her followers, or perhaps someone in particular (to prove a point).
Her last words can be those last two sentences the Buddha said and she doesn't flinch as she just stands there and stares forward and burns.
Another alternative would for someone to just find her burnt body in a rooms somewhere with the notebook next to it, but there isn't any sign of a struggle.

Perhaps she predicted that her death would spawn the wide-spread adoption of Prototheism.

## Black Notebook
We have a list of individuals who read it and attempted suicide.
This list is a table and we mention causes of death (including failed attempts leading to commas and supposed recoveries that killed themselves as soon as they were released from  suicide watch), there are many reported self-immolations.

We open with a quote where Skyshale says she was never good at lying to others and she is even worse at lying to herself.
She knows she's on a path to self-destruction now, she can't fight the truth, she doesn't know how.
## The Standard Framework
Skyshale uses the term 'self-assembling' to describe the way splinter Prototheist groups grow and merge back together.


# Characters
## Kenrick Valler
This guy is a half-black half-Mexican student journalist who wanted to interview Skyshale and got wrapped up in her weird world like so many others.
He later started CDF and the reason CDF is so into hacking culture is because Skyshale got him into hacking as a hobby, and then he joined up with the Cult of Dead Cow, which is why he named his collective the Cult of the Dead Fox after Skyshale died (her fursona was a fox).

Perhaps he's the one who originally dumped the docs to /x/ to prevent Vanilla from controlling access to them.

## Skyshale
We want to imply a narrative that although she claims her life's work is about eliminating craving and aversion, she was an addict before she got into meditation and perhaps she's just trading one addiction for another.

We want to establish the relationship she has with the rest of the players and their conflicting points of view.
Some view her has a charasmatic bi-polar cult leater who a lot of people died around and who killed herself after a breakup.
Others see her as a prophet spreading ultimate truth.

She writes in her journals while she plays with her cat using a toy on a pole she shakes with her toes.
She has a bit of an obsession with multitasking, frequently programming and having conversations at the same time.

### Appearance
I like the idea of her being an Iranian girl who came over during the Iraq war.
She has this serious look about her, like how you think of those portraits of Ayn Rand or that National Geographic girl.

### Contributions
In the contributions section of her article we say that much of the language she developed (like '8A geometry') is widely used in communities like PsychoanutWiki and Culadasa's The Mind Illuminated is widely believed to have been influenced by her work.

### Family
She is fiercely anti-islam, saying it was used to justify her mother's marriage to her alcoholic father (who she always wondered if her mother murdered.
Her mother once beat her after she caught her daughter masturbating.
Skyshale, despite being of middle-eastern descent, calls Islam the worst modern religion, saying if she was raised in her home country should wouldn't be able to shower her face.

She has a complicated relationship with her mother, who she thinks can be incredibly charming at times.
She sees her mother as having all this potential but being completely subserviant to her husband and her religion, which Skyshale resented, even as a child.

### Furry
She explains that humans are really kind of disgusting and have too many details, which is why she likes furry porn which abstracts away those details.

She's not really attracted to Kenrick or Endo, or anyone really.
But she has sex with them to build intimacy.
We have a quote that references Endo's dead name where she explains she wants to marry Endo because she loves Endo's mind, saying they have 'symmetrical' minds.

### Kasina
Skyshale got into Kasina after being influenced by Ingram's book and watning to prove it fake.
This is the start of her downfall as she becomes obsessed with what she sees as paranormal experiences and her 'universal cognition engine', whereas much of the community sees her as losing her mind.

### Personality
Skyshale used to be very withdrawn, perhaps diagnosed with aspergers, but forced herself to be social to get drugs as a kid.
But she quickly developed, Kenrick can remark about how crazy it was to see her talk in public with confidence over time when she was still so shy when he first met her.

### Rationality
She criticizes what she sees as pseudoscience in the community of polyphasic sleep and actual freedom.
Along with her criticisms of political correctness and the war on drugs, she has a lot of criticism for Buddhists who don't seek enlightenment, accusing them of misappropriating their own religion.

### Suicide
I like the idea that she died through self-immolation, similar to [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c), who she was obsessed with.
In her suicide note (the first two pages of the Black Notebook) she states that she wanted to tell her friends not to feel bad for her, that she was happy, but concepts like happiness and sadness don't mean much to her anymore.
However she is at peace.
(Am I ripping this off from something?)

I was thinking she could light herself in flames right in front of her followers, or perhaps someone in particular (to prove a point).
Her last words can be those last two sentences the Buddha said and she doesn't flinch as she just stands there and stares forward and burns.
Another alternative would for someone to just find her burnt body in a rooms somewhere with the notebook next to it, but there isn't any sign of a struggle.

Perhaps she predicted that her death would spawn the wide-spread adoption of Prototheism.

She often said that someone who is truly enlightened sees that suffering is just the cause of misunderstanding and that they could be burned alive without flinching.
Someone criticized this and challenged her to self-immolate if she was so enlightened.
She accepted that challenge, famously stating that's how she would go out when the time came.

## Tsukitei Endo
Endo is the deadname of the transgender CEO of Vanilla Corporation.
She was a Japanese salaryman who hated his job and his family. She met Skyshale online, realized she was transgender, and left her wife and kids to move to America and marry Skyshale and live her life as a woman, even though she barely spoke English.
She became one of Skyshale's most devoted disciples.

We may include this as a quote: A lot of people outside of Vanilla believe she gained her role as CEO of Vanilla because she founded it, or for some SJW reasoning regarding her being transgender.
This is incorrect.
She's had many wannabe usurpers over the years and she's always faced them down.
She's CEO because she's smart and ruthless.
She takes no income.

Perhaps there is some bad blood between her and Kenrick partially because she inherited all of Skyshale's property by virtue of being her wife, even though Kenrick believes Skyshale would have wanted it all to be public domain.

# Connections
## Dharma Overground
Maybe explain the lack of Prototheist discussion on Dharama Overground in the present by virtue of it all being banned.
Skyshale had a big presence there but it began to be seen as more and more cult-like.
Daniel Ingram later referenced her suicide, criticizing her claims of Buddhahood, saying for a Buddha she certainly attracted a lot of drama.
Last he checked Buddhas don't kill themselves.
(Posting the story to Dharma Overground or a similar meditation community for feedback would eventually be a good idea.)

# Cult of the Dead Fox
## Culture
We likely want to split the contents of this heading between 'Structure and Beliefs' and 'Culture'.

We probably want to note here their influence in the hacking and indie music and art scene and the clothing-optional nature of their properties (it should probably be more than just a passing reference).

One way to add realism is get permission to take pictures of real coops in Austin and fictionalize them as CDF properties.

Let's emphasize their CDF's interpretation of some of Skyshale's more minor points, for example they refuse to take ownership for the charity work they do.
We cite an infamous example where they were presented with an award from the city of Austin but refused to accept or acknowledge it.
We also mention that they are big attendees to NASCO.
Maybe they have a parkour and lock-picking subculture, I like the idea of regularly sponsored yearly trips to Enchanted Rock or 'real' meditation retreats.

As part of their macabre culture, they don't have signs outside their properties, they just hang a stuffed fox on a noose in front of a tree.

## Shadow library
I think they should probably operate a shadow library like libgen does, or maybe we fictionalize them contributing to that or zlib.

## Website
When we build a website for CDF we can say all hacker spaces and coops are currently closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Frame Theory
We have a quote at the beginning where Skyshale explains these frames are the smallest visible units of consciousness.
She makes a joke about them being hte 'quantum' of consicousness but also that we all know what a certain someone says about the word quantum being the biggest words in a paper.

# Inherent Bias
There should be a redirect link at the top of the section for the Wikipedia article on the statistical concept.
Maybe we should merge this with the cognitive distortions section.

Can we reference the anthropomorphic principle here?

# The Land Before Time
We can have an article about the Land Before Time in Prototheist popular culture with a description of the MST3K-style showings and a table of descriptions of the parody characters and their traits, some of the jokes listed as shoutouts perhaps.

# Nimp
We specifically mention vipassanā and increasing introspective awareness until a fruition occurs but we also want to get examples of other kinds of ego death (drug induced, merging with a kasiṇa entity, etc.) and contrast drug induced ego death with meditation-induced (the latter which Prototheists always prefer as the former only provides largely transient insight).

We can rip off personal bias supression from PsychoanutWiki as a way to describe some of the removal of self delusions.

# Notebooks
It would be great if we can eventually have a page with a table of pictures and descriptions of her 'notebooks' that we can link to, although only a few would be called 'journals'.

In a subheading we refer to The Skyshale Documents as the semi-canonical in Prototheism, we refer to the complete title as 'The Skyshale Documents' in the same way that we might refer to the "Pali Canon".

# Nouveau
On this page we want to list the common genes they knock out in a table and have a section called 'Biohacking in Prototheism' here or on the Prototheism page talking about how some Prototheists in Vanilla aren't satisfied with their chemical stack and feel pressured to compete with others by doing possibly dangerous gene knockouts.
It is believed these knockouts are done by many of the top performers in Vanilla.
(Maybe make a page called Performance enhancing substances in Prototheism to talk about the stack and biohacking.)

Maybe people believe they are an offshot of Vanilla, although this is dismissed as a conspiracy theory.

Maybe it's called the 'Lambda Leaks' because Lambda is the name of the Vanilla organization that does studies, and they did a thorough study on Nouveau that got leaked with a whole bunch of other stuff.
Lambda would be a great name for that RAND-like sub-company.
This is part of the conspiracy theory and we specifically mention the idea that Nouveau is a 'illegal subsidary' of Vanilla and these leaks (when Lambda usually has great security) is just part of the ploy.

# Prototheism
## Doctrine
### Spectrum of experience
Prototheists believe all knowable knowledge exists on a spectrum.
It doesn't make sense to think of a world without pain, as there would be no concept of pleasure.
Prototheism is about accepting experiences, not trying to escape them.

## Drug Use
In the drug use section we can have a quote from Skyshale justifying using heroin, saying you will never be happier than on it.
She references the idea of lying in bed during your honey moon and still craving heroin, making a point about the nature of craving.
If maximizing your pleasure centers still won't bring you happiness, perhaps it's time to try something different (not craving).

## Mass murders
(Maybe) A surpisingly amount of mass-murderers are Prototheists who decide the best way to reduce suffering is to kill people, or otherwise lose their minds from the Teks.
Maybe there's even a terrorism-based Prototheist collective that wants to ultimately exterminate the human race.

# Teks
## Registers
Skyshale started with playing mind-chess, expannding it with 'reversing' moves (similar to chess with time travel.)
She then developed general purpose 'registers' for storing different kinds of information and retrieving them in her mind.


# Vanilla Corporation
We call Vanilla Corporation the 'invisible titan' much like FreeBSD is the 'unseen giant'.
They frequently fund open source work through shell companies.
The almost never directly represent themselves except to other Prototheists and purposefully keep a low profile to avoid being seen as contributing to high charity for their own sake.

(Although perhaps we should focus more on CDF keeping a low profile while keeping Vanilla as a foil.)

## Funding
One of the reasons Vanilla is so exclusive and why everyone wants to join is the money.
It has more associate members than the size of any other collective but full membership is about the size of CDF.
The Standard Framework doesn't make a distinction between 'part' and 'full' members, leading to criticism of Vanilla's practice.
But still, everyone is hoping to gain enough rapport to become a full member.
TO be a full member means free health care, unlimited travel expenses, the ability to write off your research expenses as high charity costs and get reimbursed, and a monthly stipend to cover food and housing as well as a retirement pension.
Many researchers who got grants by Vanilla are trying to become full members just so they can do their research full-time.

## Criticism
One critique of Vanilla is 'self-grants' where members petition Vanilla for grants that reduce suffering primarily in themselves.
(We want to mention a specific incident and then Vanilla's justification, like the McDonald's coffee lawsuit.)
For example, a long-term (or even associate) member may ask for a new house or car.
Critics have pointed to this as evidence of the commodification of rapport which they charge has led to exclusive 'clubs' of the 'rapport wealthy'.
However Vanilla defends the practice, stating that the application process for grant money has always been transparent, requests are considered by a randomized committee on a case by case basis, and rapport is just one of many factors take into consideration.
Despite this, the number of self-grants has been dwindling in recent times, with less than 500 self-grants given in 2020 despite the larger than normal requests due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many see this as a response to criticism.

We explain the massive amounts of money they own as a result of early investments in cryptocurrency, having predicted a boon.
Remember, Skyshale wrote about cryptocurrency years before Bitcoin on the cypherpunk mailing list.
And many core Ethereum developers are Vanilla members.
In fact some have even suggested that Vanilla created Bitcoin (which we can list under the 'Criticism and Conspiracy Theories', along with the idea that they are basically a shadow government complete with their own supreme court whose citizens obey their own separate set of laws.)

Another criticism is that they shield their money-making division under the religious tax exemption.
In their 'transparent' financial reports they don't report all their assets either, thus nobody knows how many bitcoins they actually have or whether they were mined or donated.
Critics say if they really are a non-profit they should register as one.

## Gods
When explaining Vanilla's desire to build a AI superintelligence we have a quote from Skyshale explaining humans have always needed gods.

## Rapport
Rapport in Vanilla is split into permanent and seasonal rapport, like a leaderboard that is reset at regular intervals.

## Rosewood
Vanilla is super interested in Rosewood and Heyoke the Wolf in particular.
Likely because they recognize the Nether connection.
They are willing to pay large sums for additional transmissions or information on Rosewood's source.

Skyshale even alludes to the Nether at some point, calling it the seamless unspeakable something that reality as we know it is coiled into.

## Trademark
Not only are they the reference implementation for Prototheism, they also exist as the defacto authority for maintaing the core prototheist doctrine and license the trademark.
However many Prototheists criticize the idea of even having a trademark.

# Books
## Black Notebook
We have a list of individuals who read it and attempted suicide.
This list is a table and we mention causes of death (including failed attempts leading to commas and supposed recoveries that killed themselves as soon as they were released from  suicide watch), there are many reported self-immolations.

## The Standard Framework
Skyshale uses the term 'self-assembling' to describe the way splinter Prototheist groups grow and merge back together.


# Characters
## Kenrick Valler
This guy is a half-black half-Mexican student journalist who wanted to interview Skyshale and got wrapped up in her weird world like so many others.
He later started CDF and the reason CDF is so into hacking culture is because Skyshale got him into hacking as a hobby, and then he joined up with the Cult of Dead Cow, which is why he named his collective the Cult of the Dead Fox after Skyshale died (her fursona was a fox).

Perhaps he's the one who originally dumped the docs to /x/ to prevent Vanilla from controlling access to them.

## Skyshale
We want to imply a narrative that although she claims her life's work is about eliminating craving and aversion, she was an addict before she got into meditation and perhaps she's just trading one addiction for another.

We want to establish the relationship she has with the rest of the players and their conflicting points of view.
Some view her has a charasmatic bi-polar cult leater who a lot of people died around and who killed herself after a breakup.
Others see her as a prophet spreading ultimate truth.

She writes in her journals while she plays with her cat using a toy on a pole she shakes with her toes.
She has a bit of an obsession with multitasking, frequently programming and having conversations at the same time.

### Appearance
I like the idea of her being an Iranian girl who came over during the Iraq war.
She has this serious look about her, like how you think of those portraits of Ayn Rand or that National Geographic girl.

### Contributions
In the contributions section of her article we say that much of the language she developed (like '8A geometry') is widely used in communities like PsychoanutWiki and Culadasa's The Mind Illuminated is widely believed to have been influenced by her work.

### Furry
She explains that humans are really kind of disgusting and have too many details, which is why she likes furry porn which abstracts away those details.

She's not really attracted to Kenrick or Endo, or anyone really.
But she has sex with them to build intimacy.
We have a quote that references Endo's dead name where she explains she wants to marry Endo because she loves Endo's mind, saying they have 'symmetrical' minds.

### Kasina
Skyshale got into Kasina after being influenced by Ingram's book and watning to prove it fake.
This is the start of her downfall as she becomes obsessed with what she sees as paranormal experiences and her 'universal cognition engine', whereas much of the community sees her as losing her mind.

### Personality
Skyshale used to be very withdrawn, perhaps diagnosed with aspergers, but forced herself to be social to get drugs as a kid.
But she quickly developed, Kenrick can remark about how crazy it was to see her talk in public with confidence over time when she was still so shy when he first met her.

### Rationality
She criticizes what she sees as pseudoscience in the community of polyphasic sleep and actual freedom.
Along with her criticisms of political correctness and the war on drugs, she has a lot of criticism for Buddhists who don't seek enlightenment, accusing them of misappropriating their own religion.

### Suicide
I like the idea that she died through self-immolation, similar to [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c), who she was obsessed with.
In her suicide note (the first two pages of the Black Notebook) she states that she wanted to tell her friends not to feel bad for her, that she was happy, but concepts like happiness and sadness don't mean much to her anymore.
However she is at peace.
(Am I ripping this off from something?)

I was thinking she could light herself in flames right in front of her followers, or perhaps someone in particular (to prove a point).
Her last words can be those last two sentences the Buddha said and she doesn't flinch as she just stands there and stares forward and burns.
Another alternative would for someone to just find her burnt body in a rooms somewhere with the notebook next to it, but there isn't any sign of a struggle.

Perhaps she predicted that her death would spawn the wide-spread adoption of Prototheism.

She often said that someone who is truly enlightened sees that suffering is just the cause of misunderstanding and that they could be burned alive without flinching.
Someone criticized this and challenged her to self-immolate if she was so enlightened.
She accepted that challenge, famously stating that's how she would go out when the time came.

## Tsukitei Endo
Endo is the deadname of the transgender CEO of Vanilla Corporation.
She was a Japanese salaryman who hated his job and his family.
She met Skyshale online, realized she was transgender, and left her wife and kids to move to America and marry Skyshale and live her life as a woman, even though she barely spoke English.
She became one of Skyshale's most devoted disciples.

We may include this as a quote: A lot of people outside of Vanilla believe she gained her role as CEO of Vanilla because she founded it, or for some SJW reasoning regarding her being transgender.
This is incorrect.
She's had many wannabe usurpers over the years and she's always faced them down.
She's CEO because she's smart and ruthless.
She takes no income.

Perhaps there is some bad blood between her and Kenrick partially because she inherited all of Skyshale's property by virtue of being her wife, even though Kenrick believes Skyshale would have wanted it all to be public domain.

# Connections
## Dharma Overground
Maybe explain the lack of Prototheist discussion on Dharama Overground in the present by virtue of it all being banned.
Skyshale had a big presence there but it began to be seen as more and more cult-like.
Daniel Ingram later referenced her suicide, criticizing her claims of Buddhahood, saying for a Buddha she certainly attracted a lot of drama.
Last he checked Buddhas don't kill themselves.
(Posting the story to Dharma Overground or a similar meditation community for feedback would eventually be a good idea.)

# Cult of the Dead Fox
## Shadow library
I think they should probably operate a shadow library like libgen does, or maybe we fictionalize them contributing to that or zlib.

# Prototheism
## Doctrine
### Spectrum of experience
Prototheists believe all knowable knowledge exists on a spectrum.
It doesn't make sense to think of a world without pain, as there would be no concept of pleasure.
Prototheism is about accepting experiences, not trying to escape them.

## Drug Use
In the drug use section we can have a quote from Skyshale justifying using heroin, saying you will never be happier than on it.
She references the idea of lying in bed during your honey moon and still craving heroin, making a point about the nature of craving.
If maximizing your pleasure centers still won't bring you happiness, perhaps it's time to try something different (not craving).

## Mass murders
(Maybe) A surpisingly amount of mass-murderers are Prototheists who decide the best way to reduce suffering is to kill people, or otherwise lose their minds from the Teks.
Maybe there's even a terrorism-based Prototheist collective that wants to ultimately exterminate the human race.

# Teks
## Registers
Skyshale started with playing mind-chess, expannding it with 'reversing' moves (similar to chess with time travel.)
She then developed general purpose 'registers' for storing different kinds of information and retrieving them in her mind.


# Vanilla
## Rapport
Rapport in Vanilla is split into permanent and seasonal rapport, like a leaderboard that is reset at regular intervals.

## Rosewood
Vanilla is super interested in Rosewood and Heyoke the Wolf in particular.
Likely because they recognize the Nether connection.
They are willing to pay large sums for additional transmissions or information on Rosewood's source.

Skyshale even alludes to the Nether at some point, calling it the seamless unspeakable something that reality as we know it is coiled into.

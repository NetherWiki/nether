We have a quote from the Mantle at the top of this section: "A world without kings, a religion without God." although perhaps that would best be under the section for the Mantle itself.
[/todo]

The Mantle is a collection of essays written by Skyshale and partially constructed into a book before her death.
It is a collection of essays advocating a new religion that would become Prototheism (at the time called Mantleism).
Each chapter is meant to eludicate "undeniable hidden truths" that alter the reader's worldview.

The book is noted for its casual tone and nontechnical language, as well as the cecurring use of sarcasm and vulgarity.
The Mantle is littered with worldplay, reoccuring jokes, and hidden puzzles, with many modern critics favorably comparing it to GÃ¶del Escher Bach in style and subject matter.

This **glossary of Prototheist terms** is a list of definitions about the major concepts of Prototheism.

# Black Notebook
The black notebook is the infamous final journal Skyshale developed before her death.

# Cognitive Distortions
[todo]
We want to start this section (and eventually page) with the quote about Skyshale referring to delusions (personal God, etc...).
[/todo]

"Cognitive distortions" in the context of Prototheism refer to any sincere belief about objective reality that can be proven false.
In Prototheist metaphysics reality is split into two sets which contain themselves: objective reality refers to the external reality knowable through the senses and science while Subjective Reality refers to mind-frames and constructs of the thought-stream like tulpas.
Prototheists believe objective reality and subjective reality are really two sides of the same ultimate reality.

Most cognitive distortions can be resolved through simple evidence to the contrary.
While some endearing patterns of bias, such as non-Bayesian heuristics, must be unlearned over time.
But there are some delusions that are normally invisible, due to the side effects of inherent bias.
These distortions, often referred to as 'self', are non-conceptual and can only be resolved through direct experience in altered states of consciousness.
Systematically identifying and vanquishing these non-conceptual distortions is the purported goal of Prototheism, and arguably, Buddhism.

It has been argued that truly resolving the root delusion inevitably leads one to suicide, as was the case of Skyshale.

# Geas
[todo]
We should eventually move this to a new page and put interrupt phrases as a sub-section.
[/todo]

Geas are a form of rapport-based contract or self-contract found in certain Prototheist collectives, namely CDF and Vanilla as well as their splinter sects.
Geas are a type of formal promise and taboo that cannot be broken under penalty of massive loss of rapport.
They serve as the basis of interrupt phrases as well as the contracts that make up most inter-collective agreements.

# High Charity
[todo]
In the rewrite let's go back to the Wikipedia page on 'honor' and rip off some of the descriptions there.

Let's go over some of the ambigious Buddhist terms on Wikipedia and rip off how they articles describe the ambiguity.
[/todo]

In Prototheism High Charity is a multi-faceted concept that remains somewhat ambiguous with different interpretations among the major Prototheist factions.
Roughly, it refers to a hypothetical world without suffering as well as the work Prototheists do to reach that point.
It is a major tenet of Prototheism as well as its ultimate goal, although the concept is abstract and not meant to be taken literally.
It is frequently referenced in the context of 'rapport'.

All Prototheists are expected to contribute to High Charity in some way and gain rapport by forming or joining projects that maximize reduction in human suffering.
However contributing to one's own happiness is also considered valid High Charity.

# Inherent Bias
[todo]
There should be a redirect link at the top of the section for the Wikipedia article on the statistical concept.
Maybe we should merge this with the cognitive distortions section.

Can we reference the anthropomorphic principle here?
[/todo]

Inherent Bias in the context of Prototheism refers to the systemic cognitive distortions all organisms have as a side-effect of the evolutionary process.
According to Prototheism all self-aware agents must suffer from the cognitive distortions associated with inherent bias, include the root delusion nebulously known as 'self.'
Although humanity owes its success to its ability to rationally view the world, the existence of inherent bias in the knowledge of man's inevitable death leads to absurdities, such as the invention of God.

# Interrupt Phrases
[todo]
Maybe starts off with a Skyshale quote from The Mantle justifying the use of interrupt phrases in the context of Elbereth and absolute honesty.
She references examples in her life if two people simply honestly stated how they felt without judgment years of suffering could have been avoided.
She probably recommends starting Elbereth only if one is mature, with another mature person, possibly under the influence of light dosages of MDMA.

In the rewrite we want to mention the idea of offering a 'gambit' which must be accepted before a context switch, we want to elaborate on the protocol for initiating and accepting one.
[/todo]

In Prototheism interrupt phrases are certain words or sentences that when spoken between two Prototheists formally change the context and rules of the conversation.
Examples of these 'context switches' include forcing participants to be absolutely honest, forcing the participants to keep the conversation in absolute secrecy, or more casual uses such a demanding participant's attention or drafting a Prototheist contract.
Interrupt phrases are backed by geas and breaking them is therefore taboo, resulting in a forfeiture of rapport.

# Mental Catalysts
In Prototheism a catalyst is a drug used to induce or prolong a particular state of consciousness.
In its broadest meaning a catalyst can refer to any psychoactive compound including commonly used drugs like caffeine or amphetamine.
However the term is almost always used in the context of specific mixtures of psychedelic substances that were developed by Skyshale as part of her research.

These compounds are used as 'mental seteriods' to speed development of psychonautic training.
A classic example is vipassanā meditation, which usually takes many years of dedicated practice to master.
Even though the goal of vipassanā is to increase introspective awareness, introspective awareness is needed to determine if subtle changes in technique are improving or hindering practice, leading to a chicken and egg problem and much frustration for beginners.
Catalysts alleviate this by temporarily boosting introspective awareness, allowing the mediator to better understand how they need to alter their technique to make progress.

Mental catalysts can push vipassanā mediators years forward in their practice, but are meant to be taken sparingly and not as substitutes for sober training.

# Nimp
[todo]
We specifically mention vipassanā and increasing introspective awareness until a fruition occurs but we also want to get examples of other kinds of ego death (drug induced, merging with a kasiṇa entity, etc.) and contrast drug induced ego death with meditation-induced (the latter which Prototheists always prefer as the former only provides largely transient insight).
[/todo]

Nimp, also referred to as 'ego death', 'fruition', 'nirvana', or an 'insight experience' refers to an altered state of consciousness where a person temporarily loses their subjective self-identity.
It is the ultimate end-point of a successful vipassanā cycle and can also be induced through common psychedelic drugs such as LSD.

# Rapport
[todo]
Vanilla actually quantified rapport as a cryptocurrency (with geas also quantified as smart contracts on the blockchain).
This drew criticism from CDF and its splinter factions, as Skyshale never mentioned monetizing rapport in this way.
Vanilla's rapport tokens are a combination of z-cash / ether / web of trust, and the latter prevents people from simply buying rapport using flat currency.
[/todo]

Rapport is an abstract concept referring to units of social confidence traded not unlike a currency in Prototheists circles.
Rapport is a measure of a Prototheists' reputation or social standing.
Some collectives, notably Vanilla, have quantified rapport in the form of cryptocurrency tokens.
For most Prototheists however, rapport is an informal, albeit important part of their identity.

Rapport is gained by contributing to High Charity, that is, reducing human suffering.
Gaining rapport makes it easier to collaborate with other Prototheists who also have high rapport, and in that way confers power and prestige in one's Prototheist collective.
For example, Vanilla only accepts associates as full members after a specific amount of rapport has been gained, encouraging associates to compete with one another over participation in projects that provide a wide-spread social good.

The concept is not without criticism however, with some likening the system to a popularity contest.

# Root Delusion
[todo]
We describe the root delusion in somewhat mystical terms, stating that Prototheists believe it 'binds' beings to this place of existence (similar to language in Buddhism regarding clinging to self).
However we note that even though Buddhism is also a religion dedicated to penetration the delusionary nature of self, it succeeds only partially.
To fully remove the root delusion, as Skyshale did, is to walk a path that inevitably leads to self-destruction.

We note that Prototheists believe the root delusion (self) is the root of all suffering.
We could mention the three characteristics here, but that should probably go in the meditation section.
We should probably use the term 'non-dual' in the rewrite.

Where's the explanation that fully removing the root delusion also removes the will to live?
Buddhism doesn't go that far, unlike what's written in Skyshale's black notebook.
[/todo]

The root delusion refers to the delusional point of view that all mind-agents share to some degree, from microscopic organisms to hypothetical super-intelligence.
It is variously titled 'self' or 'ego'.
Put another way, it is the belief in the inherent separation between the observer and the observed, the mental barrier a life-form constructs between itself and its environment.
It is sometimes succinctly described as the belief that life is preferable to death.

This belief in separation between self and not-self seems intuitive ("My feet are me, my shoes are not me.")
But Prototheists believe this point of view is ultimately delusional.
And that this delusion is the root cause of all human suffering.

# Zebulon Protocol
[todo]
The name is a lot worse that I thought it would be, we need to come up with a better one.

We will eventually move this to its own page, which has a revision history section, including Skyshale introducing a second revision to counter the psycho­tic breaks people were having.
Under "development model" we have a criticism sub-heading where we state that although scientific studies are required to be taken seriously, Vanilla's child corporation (which does free-lance scientific research on my subject and are supposedly unbiased with quality comparable to the RAND corporation and congressional research reports, and are therefore supposedly unbiased although as we mention on their page some people question their loyalty to Vanilla) does most of the research and charges money for it.
Vanilla are the ones who usually give grants to pay for proposals to be formally studied, so in this way they can pick and choose proposals more than other groups, leading to criticism.
[/todo]

The Zebulon Protocol is a technique developed by Skyshale as an attempt to isolate a methodology for achieving classic Buddhist enlightenment and to do so as quickly and safely as possible.
The protocol was developed with the ultimate goal of teaching it to as many people as possible.
It is so named because the first working commite to formalize Skyshale's research on the subject was hosted in Zebulon, North Carolina.
It has gone through four major revisions, three under Skyshale's leadership and one posthumously.
It was to be standardized a fifth time but the working committee was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Unlike other meditation techniques, the Zebulon Protocol is developed by a working group, in much the same way the IEEE accepts and votes on proposals for standards.
Contributors are expected to back their proposed amendments through scientific studies. 

# Vipassanā
[todo]
Do we really want to keep this unicode in the title?

Perhaps mention that even though the jhanas were known at the time of the Buddha, the discovery of vipassanā was his real contribution.
[/todo]

Vipassanā is a form of meditation popularized in Buddhism and used to achieve insight into ultimate reality via the cultivation of altered states of consciousness.
In a nutshell, it is the meditation Buddhists perform to become enlightened.

Vipassanā isn't a specific technique, but rather a methodology for breaking up reality into discrete units Prototheists refer to as frames.
Prototheists see vipassanā and samatha as a spectrum, with modern techniques such as the Zebulon Protocol incorporating a mixture of both aspects with the addition of optional catalysts.

(Not practiced directly by Prototheists, mostly practice with catalysts)

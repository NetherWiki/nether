This **glossary of Prototheist terms** is a list of definitions about the major concepts of Prototheism.

# Black Notebook
The black notebook is the infamous final journal Skyshale developed before her death.

# Cognitive Distortions
[todo]
We want to start this section (and eventually page) with the quote about Skyshale referring to delusions (personal God, etc...).
[/todo]

"Cognitive distortions" in the context of Prototheism refer to any sincere belief about objective reality that can be proven false.
In Prototheist metaphysics reality is split into two sets which contain themselves: objective reality refers to the external reality knowable through the senses and science while Subjective Reality refers to mind-frames and constructs of the thought-stream like tulpas.
Prototheists believe objective reality and subjective reality are really two sides of the same ultimate reality.

Most cognitive distortions can be resolved through simple evidence to the contrary.
While some endearing patterns of bias, such as non-Bayesian heuristics, must be unlearned over time.
But there are some delusions that are normally invisible, due to the side effects of inherent bias.
These distortions, often referred to as 'self', are non-conceptual and can only be resolved through direct experience in altered states of consciousness.
Systematically identifying and vanquishing these non-conceptual distortions is the purported goal of Prototheism, and arguably, Buddhism.

It has been argued that truly resolving the root delusion inevitably leads one to suicide, as was the case of Skyshale.

# Geas
[todo]
We should eventually move this to a new page and put interrupt phrases as a sub-section.
[/todo]

Geas are a form of rapport-based contract or self-contract found in certain Prototheist collectives, namely CDF and Vanilla as well as their splinter sects.
Geas are a type of formal promise and taboo that cannot be broken under penalty of massive loss of rapport.
They serve as the basis of interrupt phrases as well as the contracts that make up most inter-collective agreements.

# High Charity
[todo]
In the rewrite let's go back to the Wikipedia page on 'honor' and rip off some of the descriptions there.
[/todo]

In Prototheism High Charity is a multi-faceted concept that remains someone ambiguous with different interpretations among the major Prototheist factions.
Roughly, it refers to a hypothetical world without suffering as well as the work Prototheists do to reach that point.
It is a major tenet of Prototheism, although the concept is abstract and not meant to be taken literally.
It is frequently referenced in the context of 'rapport'.

All Prototheists are expected to contribute to High Charity in some way and gain rapport by forming or joining projects that maximize reduction in human suffering.

# Inherent Bias
[todo]
There should be a redirect link at the top of the section for the Wikipedia article on the statistical concept.
Maybe we should merge this with the cognitive distortions section.

Can we reference the anthropomorphic principle here?
[/todo]

Inherent Bias in the context of Prototheism refers to the systemic cognitive distortions all organisms have as a side-effect of the evolutionary process.
According to Prototheism all self-aware agents must suffer from the cognitive distortions associated with inherent bias, include the root delusion nebulously known as 'self.'
Although humanity owes its success to its ability to rationally view the world, the existence of inherent bias in the knowledge of man's inevitable death leads to absurdities, such as the invention of God.

# Interrupt Phrases
[todo]
Maybe starts off with a Skyshale quote from The Mantle justifying the use of interrupt phrases in the context of Elbereth and absolute honesty.
She references examples in her life if two people simply honestly stated how they felt without judgment years of suffering could have been avoided.
She probably recommends starting Elbereth only if one is mature, with another mature person, possibly under the influence of light dosages of MDMA.

In the rewrite we want to mention the idea of offering a 'gambit' which must be accepted before a context switch, we want to elaborate on the protocol for initiating and accepting one.
[/todo]

In Prototheism interrupt phrases are certain words or sentences that when spoken between two Prototheists formally change the context and rules of the conversation.
Examples of these 'context switches' include forcing participants to be absolutely honest, forcing the participants to keep the conversation in absolute secrecy, or more casual uses such a demanding participant's attention or drafting a Prototheist contract.
Interrupt phrases are backed by geas and breaking them is therefore taboo, resulting in a forfeiture of rapport.

# Root Delusion
[todo]
We describe the root delusion in somewhat mystical terms, stating that Prototheists believe it 'binds' beings to this place of existence (similar to language in Buddhism regarding clinging to self).
However we note that even though Buddhism is also a religion dedicated to penetration the delusionary nature of self, it succeeds only partially.
To fully remove the root delusion, as Skyshale did, is to walk a path that inevitably leads to self-destruction.

We note that Prototheists believe the root delusion (self) is the root of all suffering.
We could mention the three characteristics here, but that should probably go in the meditation section.
We should probably use the term 'non-dual' in the rewrite.

Where's the explanation that fully removing the root delusion also removes the will to live?
Buddhism doesn't go that far, unlike what's written in Skyshale's black notebook.
[/todo]

The root delusion refers to the delusional point of view that all mind-agents share to some degree, from microscopic organisms to hypothetical super-intelligence.
It is variously titled 'self' or 'ego'.
Put another way, it is the belief in the inherent separation between the observer and the observed, the mental barrier a life-form constructs between itself and its environment.
It is sometimes succinctly described as the belief that life is preferable to death.

This belief in separation between self and not-self seems intuitive ("My feet are me, my shoes are not me.")
But Prototheists believe this point of view is ultimately delusional.
And that this delusion is the root cause of all human suffering.

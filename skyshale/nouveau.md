They are French in origin.

Their Deep Web market is called 'Dark Side'.

They have a complicated relationship with Vanilla and CDF, as both groups don't endorse Nouveau's illegal activity publicly, but it's still the best place to purchase drugs and biohacking supplies.
They have collaborated with CDF at times on software development through patches and pull requests and they develop NODE and Trip.tv.

On this page we want to list the common genes they knock out in a table and have a section called 'Biohacking in Prototheism' here or on the Prototheism page talking about how some Prototheists in Vanilla aren't satisfied with their chemical stack and feel pressured to compete with others by doing possibly dangerous gene knockouts.
It is believed these knockouts are done by many of the top performers in Vanilla.
(Maybe make a page called Performance enhancing substances in Prototheism to talk about the stack and biohacking.)

Nouveau is a clandestine Prototheist collective and a major distributor of illegal drugs on the deep web.
What little is known about them has primarily been sourced through the Lambda Leaks.
The collective is the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, such as that Nouveau is a state actor, the Lambda Leaks were staged, or that Nouveau is an illegal subsidiary of Vanilla.

Aside from drugs Nouveau is also the leading provider of biohacking plasmids and viral vectors.

Psychonautic Catalysts are substances or physical augmentations that enhance psychonautic exploration.
Example include the use of LSD in the Zebulon Protocol or GHB in lucid dreaming.
The definition of a catalyst has changed over time and now generally includes non-psychedelic substances such as Amphetamines or Modafinil, which are core components of Prototheist Stacks.
With the increased avaiability of biohacking components sold by [Nouveau](nouveau.md), catalysts also include DIY gene therapy kits such as myostatin knockouts.

# Psychedelic Substances
Microdosages of psychedlic mixtures has been shown to radically decrease the time required to build one's metacognitive awareness compared to unaugmented vipassana meditation.
One study shows a 40x improvement in speed of a subject's initial vipassana cycle when following the Zebulon Protocol for one hour a day compared to the equivlaent time spend practicing Mahasi Noting as taught by a professional instructor.
Psychonautic catalysts, especially specific mixtures, allow a layperson practicing for an hour a day to achieve rates of progress normally only associated with retreat conditions.

A common misunderstanding is that catalysts are required for further progress in vipassana.
However this is not the case.
The Zebulon Protocol proscribes catalysts are regular intervals as way of 'snapshotting' one's progress.
However most practice is still conducted sober, and the protocol specifies that catalysts not be used during the fruition experience.

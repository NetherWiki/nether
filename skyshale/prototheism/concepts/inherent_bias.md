In Prototheist doctrine Inherent Bias (also known as Anthropic Bias) refers to the correctable cognitive distortions all sapient life normally shares as a side effect of the evolutionary process.
It refers to the delusions derived from an unexamined view of 'self' and the repetitive suffering that spawn from them.

Inherent Bias exists because in order for life to thrive it must hold certain non-factual beliefs.
These beliefs take the form of a nonsensical view of 'self', such as the belief that the self is autonomous from its environment, that it must be maintained and guarded against this environment, and that changes to the environment can satisfy the self in any lasting way.
Without these beliefs organisms would allow themselves to die and life as we know it would not evolve.
Put succinctly, Inherent Bias is the irrational belief that being alive is perferable to being dead.

Inherent Bias is the source of all forms of suffering.
Prototheists believe all suffering is caused by misunderstanding, not a consequence of pain but a reaction to it.
Skyshale famously stated that one could be burned alive without suffering, as long as they did not share the delusions of self.
Correcting Inherent Bias is also associated with Buddhism and the experience of nirvana the three characteristics.

Suffering caused by Inherent Bias, such as fear of death, is widespread but generally transparent to most people.
It has lead humanity to develop all sorts of bizzare coping mechanisms, such as the invention of God.

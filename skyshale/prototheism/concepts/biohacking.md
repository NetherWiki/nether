We probably want to merge this article with the topic of nootropics and nootropic stacks and introduce the concept of these stacks and their place in Prototheism first.

Biohacking is a prevalent and controversial phenomenon in Prototheist circles.
It usually takes the form of unregulated DIY gene therapy via targeted gene activation and deactivation using CRISPR-Cas9.
Prototheists perform gene therapy to enhance intelligence, physical appearance, or to correct for existing defects.
Almost all gene therapy related biohacking is performed using pre-made injectable vectors sold by [Nouveau](nouveau.md) through [Dark Side](dark_side.md).

Do to the novel and unregulated nature of gene therapy through CRISPR-Cas9 the practice is considered dangerous.
Off-target effects may occur which heighten the risk of cancer and further genetic mutations.
There is particularly controversy around specific Dark Side branded kits that cross the germ line, leading to permanent modification in individuals and their offspring, influencing the human gene pool for generations to come.

# Controversy
The phenomenon if prevalent among researchers at Vanilla Corporation who must contend with an intensely competitive grant process.
High achievers who have already exhausted their nootropic stacks may feel pressured by peers who have already received genetic modification in order to compete at an otherwise superhuman level.

Let's see if we can go back and find that "wish list" of genes to change and import it as examples of common genes that Prototheists alter.
We also want to associate a brand name with these stacks on Dark Side.
We can even present the list as an anonymous poll by popularity at a recent Prototheist convention along with other stats like how many members of each collective choose to take nootropics, how many choose to genetically modify themselves.
Perhaps we can also include other aspects of biohacking.

## Potential banning
The topic has become so controversial that a ban on the use of genetic enhancements by Vanilla's membership was put up by the board of directors in 2019.
The proposal was not passed, with a majority citing a concern for personal autonomy and the infeasibility of enforcement.

[todo]
Perhaps we have a quote at the top of the (mainly stub) article from an anonymous CDF shitposter who says this is why nobody will take Prototheism seriously, ponies.

The Solar Doctrine is an MLP-based Prototheist collective originating from the online image board community.
SD places an emphasis on tulpamancy, especially with characters from the My Little Pony universe.

Despite being a registered collective SD appears to lack a coherent structure.
The article for SD on the Vanilla website notes that SD representatives have never attended any Prototheist working groups.

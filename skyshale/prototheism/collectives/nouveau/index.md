Nouveau (full name: The Nouveau Group) is an unregistered candestine french Prototheist collective best known for their darknet marketplace 'Dark Side'.
Nouveau is one of the most popular distributors of illegal drugs on the deep web.
They are the source of choice for Prototheists looking for high quality components of psychonautic catalysts, such as LSD.
They are the only distributor of many popular biohacking and gene therapy stacks, such as myostatin knockouts.
Nouveau is by necessary a criminal organization.

Little is known about the size or internal structure of its membership, information that has been gathered has primarily been sourced through the Lambda Leaks.
Nouveau believes the best avenue to High Charity is through distribution of Nimp-inducing substances to as wide as an audience as possible.
Ethenogens like DMT are sold at cost and Dark Side generally provides the lowest prices in the illegal drug trade, although Nouveau generally does not sell in bulk.


Nouveau retains a tenuous relatipnship with other Prototheist collectives, especially Vanilla.
Nouveau is not recognized by Vanilla as a registered Prototheist collective and has no official authority to amend Prototheist doctrine or participate in working groups.
Despite this, the collective retains formidable 'soft power' in shaping Prototheist politics.

Despite being a criminal enterprise, it is widely known that Nouveau is the perferred source of psychoanutic catalysts for nearly all Prototheists due to their price, high quality, and the speed and discretion of their shipping.
They have openly collaborated with CDF in the past through pull requests for NODE and Trip.tv.

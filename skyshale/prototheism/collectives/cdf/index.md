---

The Cult of the Dead Fox (frequently referred to by the acronym CDF or simply as 'the Cult') is an austin-based Prototheist collective specializing in cooperative housing.
It was founded by Kenrick Valler as one of the original two implementations of post-sectarian Prototheism and remains one of the most widely-known and influential sects.

CDF adherents, known as cultists, seek High Charity through personal enlightenment and anonymous grass-roots philanthropic action.
They live in a monestary-like atmosphere meditating during the day and performing charitable work by night.
All CDF facilities are clothing optional.

The name is taken from the Cult of Dead Cow, a hacker group which Kenrick belonged to before meeting Skyshale.
Skyshale used a fox as her fursona and the organization was started shortly after her death.
CDF's logo is a vaguely-anthropormophic fox hung (in an apparent suicide) from a noose.
It is based off of a doodle found in one of Skyshale's notebooks.
CDF properties are well known for lacking physical signs, instead the entrances are marked by a stuffed fox dangling from a noose on a nearby tree.

# Drug use
Like most Prototheist collectives, CDF maintains a lax position on drug use.
Many adherents defend psychedelics as a tool towards enlightenment and part of their religion, although there has been concern in recent years with members using CDF properties to traffic drugs.

# Culture
CDF is known for its emphasis on communalism and rigid adherence to the organization's interpretation of High Charity.
A common in-joke is that there are no 'casual' CDF members.
Even so CDF is known for its friendliness to outsiders.
CDF coops have become popular among university students looking for a cheaper alternative to West campus living and those interested in exploring meditation or charity works.
CDF's reputation is entirely spread by word of mouth.
Advertising and proselytizing are explicitly forbidden by the corporate charter.

CDF maintains an established hacking culture in part to Kenrick's own experience as a professional penetration tester.
Like Vanilla, many cultists are contributors to open-source software.
Examples of projects with significant CDF influence includes the Linux kernel and FreeBSD project, Metasploit, HackTheBox, OpenVAS, and the nearly-released Flipper Zero.

## Memes
CDF is known for its cynical and self-aware wit.
In-jokes and memes are commonly depicted as art on CDF properties.
CDF maintains a friendly (and arguably one-sided) rivalry with Vanilla, the latter is frequently portrayed on CDF imageboards as corporate and sterile in contrast to CDF which is depicted as organic and grass-roots.
Although this supposed rivalry hasn't stopped many grad students living in CDF coops from applying for memberships or grants at Vanilla after they graduate.

Cross-overs with Neon Genesis Evangelion are a common source of parody.
Vanilla is frequently compared to Nerv and Vanilla's intention to bring about a technological singularity likened to Third Impact and Instrumentality.
Photoshopped images of Vanilla's CEO wearing the iconic outfit of Gendo Ikari are a staple of CDF shitposting, along with anthropomorphic animal pornography and tired references to the Land Before Time series.

Another common meme is that CDF should not be mentioned to non-members (with many jokingly denying it exists) because if it goes too mainstream it will become ruined.
The second part of this joke is a reply that, in contrast, CDF has already gone mainstream and is therefore ruined.

# Membership
CDF is generally seen as open and friendly to both visitors.
Although membership requirements are less strict than Vanilla CDF culture dictates certain in-jokes and rituals before a member can be accepted.
These include the joke that the membership coordinator is always too busy to be seen, forcing prospective members to camp outside CDF properties, sometimes for weeks, before being seen.
Although some see this as a harmless reference to Fight Club, others criticize it as a form of hazing.

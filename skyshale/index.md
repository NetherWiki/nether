I find by default I usually write stories about men doing things, with female characters as an afterthought.
I would to reverse that with this story, where it's mostly women who are the main characters and men are an aside.

Skyshale was an American cult leader, essayist, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), futurist, furry, autodidact, polymath, and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) best known as the controversial founder of Prototheism, Frame Theory, for her research into ego-dissolution and other altered forms of consciousness.
A talented and prolific author, Skyshale developed an extensive collection of research notes, essays, and manuscripts, codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals which remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Through her research into meditation and psychedelic drug use Skyshale pioneered several techniques for radically augmenting human consciousness.
Through the use of carefully-selected psychoactive compounds, Skyshale believed those who followed her protocol could 'leap-frog' through their meditative practice, condensing what might be years of decades of intense daily [VipassanƒÅ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) into mere months to achieve classical Buddhist enlightenment.

Skyshale's life and death has been marked by controversy.
Her suicide has been repeated replicated by other Prototheists who have read her work in what critics have called copycat cult suicides.
Prototheists claim such suicides are the inevitable consequence of fully vanquishing the root delusion.
The infamous 'black notebook' remains a centerpiece of this debate.

# Research
[todo]
We will create a new Prototheist teks page which contains a description of what the teks are and a list of them.
Here we link to it, but we don't duplicate most of the content, we have a little more descrption on the Prototheist page.

To avoid redundancy, let's work on this page next rather than the pages that link to it.

# Personality & opinions
## Views on intellectual property
Skyshale was fiercely critical of modern intellectual property laws, claiming that are abused by corporations to prevent competition and stifle the creation of new media, rather than encourage it.

# Criticism
## Allegations of scientific racism
[todo]
We expand this by mentioning that these allegations are made despite the fact that she had an African-American boyfriend, Kenrick Valler, who would go on to found CDF.
[/todo]

Some criticize Skyshale for what they regard as racist comments regarding her tentative assertion that there are biological factors for intelligence between gender and ethnicity.

header: Skyshale
---

[todo]
In the rewrite let's further split the contents between this page and Skyshale's page (maybe renaming "Skyshale" to "Skyshale (Person)").
This page will deal with the contents of her writing and the influence it had on Prototheism and the web as a whole after it got leaked to /x/.
The history section of this page is minimal and links to Skyshale's page where we have a lot more of her history.

At the beginning we mention what seems like her increasing mental instability which is reflected in her writings, some think they're nothing more than the deranged ramblings of a narcissistic sociopath, and even hardcore Prototheists have trouble reconciling her more outrageous claims at the end, she seems to have lost her mind.

We reference in this first section that these documents are widely seen as the original authority on Prototheist canon and viewed by some as scripture.
[/todo]

The Skyshale Documents are a collection of journals, essays, fiction, and research notes that Skyshale developed her lifetime.
Many of these documents are available to read online and server as the basis for the quickly growing new religious movement known as Prototheism.

# History
## Early Years
[todo]
As stated before, most of this todo will be moved out in the rewrite.

We should have a quote from Skyshale's perspective about how she didn't really make friends until middle/high school and even then she really only hung out to do drugs, she never cared for kids her own age, preferring the company of adults on IRC and web communities.
It was only online she felt like she could be herself, no one knows you're a 13-year-old girl behind a screen-name.
She bemoans the fact that all the adults in her life were the kind of people who assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children, they weren't interested in her ideas, they were interested in being right.

There's another quote when she explains (she made this quote when she was like 16) that she never really had a childhood, sometimes it feels like she was born as an adult.
Her mother was institutionalized three times before she finished middle school.
She lost her virginity in seventh grade.
By high school she was combining cocaine and heroin (for science  of course, as she explains).
She says she wouldn't recommend her life, and in no way sees it as health, but it was...interesting.
She goes on to explain there's nothing like a little trauma to catalyze mental and spiritual growth.
(And perhaps at the bottom we have a note from her 'editor' which is Kenrick that reads: "You call that a little?!")
(For that last editor note we can highlight the text and using mouse-over explain that Kenrick served as an editor for some of her initial essay and incomplete auto-biography, he was irked when Vanilla seized all of her notebooks and decided to leak what he had after a while.)

We can make a subtle Easter egg to candle cover (and mention this in the developer commentary) by having a quote where she mentions that form among others she liked to visit, RoseNET as well.
[/todo]

Skyshale began writing a journal when her grandmother bought her a notebook at thirteen.
Over the course of her lifetime she would fill out over a hundred physical notebooks, mainly to document her experiences with altered states of consciousness.

Skyshale began experimenting with lucid dreaming in elementary school and kept a dream journal.
By sixth grade would have multiple lucid dreams a week using the wake-back-to-bed technique she learned on Reddit.

In middle school she was introduced to marijuana and quickly became fascinated, devoting an entire notebook to describing her experience smoking it, which she hid in her rent.
Already fascinated by cognitive psychology, Sky shale was surprised that the subjective effects of a drug as easily-available had been so poorly documented. She was frustrated to find the effects were so intoxicating, comparing it unfavorably to alcohol.

[todo]
Adding to the last quote: May be she says she had an older boyfriend in middle school she slept with just because he had access to drugs
"They say cannabis isn't addictive but at the time I found myself getting addicted to anything that distracted me from the fact that I exist."
(Perhaps she also mentions being willing to just pick pills she found on the ground and pop them, she didn't know anything about LSD when she first took it except that it made you 'see stuff'.)
She explains that she actually felt bad about it because he really did love her, or as much as you can love someone is a teenager.
He was a nice guy but how interesting is the average 19 year old? She only used him for the drugs.

Her experience with the nitrous oxide and LSD was a turning point for her.
She says she had been search in her whole life for that experience, that lack of self.
Previously she thought she would kill herself.
She says she can, divide her life to before and after her LSD trip, it was a true spiritual revelation.
Maybe we even quote her as saying her mother had a near-death experience and become very religious afterwards.
But she explains she has had nearly the same experience but didn't become religious because she could repeat the experience at will.
[/todo]

Looking to experiment with other drugs, Skyshale began using whippets and LSD.
In eighth grade Skyshale with a group of friends broke into her boyfriend's father's dentist office and stole a tank of nitrous oxide.
She spent the night taking LSD and slowly increasing the dose, writing down her experiences.

[todo]
We want to clarify the timeline of what she takes and when.
She probably did LSD before and was fascinated by it, but it was the mix with nitrous that caused her to stumble up on ego death and catalyzed her spiritual development.

She explains before she did all the drugs, by 14 she did all the drugs you heard of and many you haven't.
We can explain how depressed she was, and she can make that comment about heroin apathy and molly euphoria, but ego death wasn't covering things up, it was removing suffering.
She was completely at peace with any event happening anywhere in the universe.
She realized that she wanted to feel that way all the time, or as close as she could.
When she stepped out at like Sun the next day, while everyone else was passed out, she stood on the chimney of the roof and watched the sun rise and knew she had stumbled upon something she had been searching for her whole life, maybe all her previous lives.
She watched the sun rise and it was the most beautiful sun rise she had ever seen.
She knew her life would never be the same.
Nothing changed but everything was different.
Opioids no longer held appeal to her, how could she possibly go back?
That morning she vowed to free herself from all craving and attachment, to vanquish suffering, or get as close as humanly possible.
[/todo]

She counts that night as one of the most important experiences in her life, ranking up with the birth of her daughter.
After that experience Skyshale claimed to lose all interest in the escapist aspects of drugs, using heroin only to further her study into the nature of craving.
She became obsessed with entheogens, insight experiences, and the nature of enlightenment.

[todo]
This whole section is going on a little too long and gets less interesting after this point, so we'll probably summarize and skip ahead to focus more on her post-school years.
[/todo]

In high school sSkyshale had already cultivated a reputation as a 'drug girl' and her grades suffered as she spent her free time documenting her drug use.

[todo]
So anyway we specifically mention in the above quote that she came to a realization.
A very Buddhist realization, although she mentions she had no concept of Buddhism at the time.
She realized that the happiness she desired couldn't depend on external things, it would have to be something she carried around with her always, thus it wouldn't be her emotional state but outside of it.
She became interested in trying to maintain her Zen even in horrible circumstances, inspired by that monk on fire, she started looking deeply at her negative emotions, wanting to delineate the physical pulses of pain from the mental pulses of reactive aversion that follow.
This is how she started purposefully stabbing herself and stinging herself with insects while meditating.

We probably want to make this a separate sub-section, maybe she had other people from school who joined her and we can include some quotes from them (am I ripping off Rant now?).

At some point we want to mention when she first saw that photograph of the burning monk, and her reaction to it.
We can have a quote where she explains that after seeing the image she knew Buddhism was at least partially correct, although she previously dismissed it for being as zany as the other major religions.
But how could you argue with empirical evidence?
A photograph with eye-witnesses?
Where are the photos of Christian monks setting themselves on fire without flinching?

Maybe the burning monk was on the ink blotter she got and it was ominous, she wondered why someone would depict a monk burning to death and it turned her off, but she took the drug anyway making a mental note to investigate the image after.
[/todo]

She began working on a collection of documents that would form The Mantle, developing an ideological basis to explain her conception of reality.
As a way of refining her understanding of suffering, Sky shale began experimenting with small self-inflicted injuries.

[todo]
We have a quote something like: "I wanted to experience pain without the danger.
I knew girls who cut themselves and I always found it pathetic.
Sad but pathetic.
You won't gain anything but attention from self-injury and if I wanted attention I would ask for it.
I wasn't doing it to hurt myself, I was doing it to know the difference between pain and suffering."

We want the quote to have somewhat sociopathic undertones.
In this quote we also want to show how intellectually fascinated she is by these insect stings, as it's all an illusion, no real damage is done.
She makes direct references to frame theory here.

The below bit certainly goes in Skyshale's biography page and not here, and it probably makes more sense for it to be a college presentation.
She never went back after being kicked out, and we can mention in developer commentary that we would love to eventually make this film as a short.
[/todo]

Skyshale was suspended from high school after releasing a student project where she documented purposefully getting addicted to heroin and then breaking the addiction, having interviews with other junkies.
Skyshale never returned to school, living at her grandmother's house under her death and legally taking control of the property at the age of 18.

[todo]
I'm sure we can work in some drama with Skyshale, her mom, and her grandmother, as the grandmother left everything to Skyshale.
We might also want to work in a social worker, a social worker's notes on Skyshale would be interesting, but perhaps unrealistic as it would be a break of confidentiality.

If she had herself legally emancipated, perhaps she didn't wait until she was 18 to take control of the property.
[/todo]

## The Hillsborough House
[todo]
We reduce the previous section and open this section with Kenrick meeting Skyshale after an argument on Dharma Overground regarding some of her claims, we quote him as talking about how infuriated he was with her and him eventually driving to her house to give her a piece of his mind.
(Although this conflicts with Kenrick's background as a student-reporter.)
When he goes in he sees she's just completely naked on the couch as she writes in her journal and thinks she's lost her mind, but they have a conversation and they keep talking over night, he keeps trying to trip her up as she justifies what would become Prototheism, speaking with the mesmerizing conviction of a sage or psychotic.

Or we could make this a completely different person, her first disciple, but not that important to the story.
This guy visits her over and over again until eventually moving in and telling his friends.

In this section we also want a separate quote from someone that summarizes the situation, perhaps someone who says they used to be in the army but they were terrified by this 19 year old naked woman, not because she was cruel, she was never cruel, but because she was indifferent, and seemed to grow more indifferent day by day.

This person doesn't really know how she survived, the house was paid off but she didn't have a job.
She ate a lot of beans out of cans and at first they thought it was because she was trying to eliminate craving but then they realized she was just poor.

Sometimes the cops would come with a noise complaint, although this person can't recall the house ever being really noisy, mostly the cops just came to make sure she was okay.
People saw her as a burnt out high school junkie who didn't have a job and whored herself to men, they took pity on her, but they didn't know her like they knew her.
As this person explains she didn't have sex with anyone but her long-term relationships, none of them would have touched her anyway, they weren't worthy, it would have been sacrilege.

(Also in the same quote): From time to time a woman would show up, claim to be her mother.
They would go to a private room to talk, sometimes fight.
I never heard SKyshale raise her voice outside of those meetings, I didn't even recognize the voice as hers at first.
Later I heard the grandmother left everything to Skyshale and nothing to her daughter.
The only time I saw Skyshale cry was after her mother's death.
(And perhaps it is the tears from her mother's death that convinces Skyshale she hasn't yet completely thrown off suffering, leading her down a dark path of obsession that eventually leads to her downfall.)

It would be great if we can eventually have a page with a table of pictures and descriptions of her 'notebooks' that we can link to, although only a few would be called 'journals'.

For now let's just stick to her developing a method for enlightenment, we can introduce more concepts like tulpas after the initial article and her history and social relationships have been established.

We mention in the splash section that she's a futurist.

In a subheading we refer to The Skyshale Documents as the semi-canonical in Prototheism, we refer to the complete title as 'The Skyshale Documents' in the same way that we might refer to the "Pali Canon".

In the rewrite we want to mention the black journal in the splash page at the end and controversy regarding whether or last few notebooks were valid or if she became psychotic (are they canon)?

When I first start working on this article I found myself having a lot of trouble with these first few paragraphs, constantly writing and re-arranging them with that kind of timidness that plagues a lot of novices writers.

I believe that kind of obsessive perfectionism can be useful, in fact I built the wiki around the concept of never-ending updates, but it can also prevent you from getting anything done.

I have to stop and remind myself that I need to actually put something down before I edit it.
It's why I can only write on my phone or long-hand.
Having access to the backspace button is just too tempting, it kills my workflow.

I find by default I usually write stories about men doing things, with female characters as an afterthought.
I would to reverse that with this story, where it's mostly women who are the main characters and men are an aside.

There are three main concepts we want to sell in this initial splash section:

- Skyshale was a polymath and wrote extensively, a cult formed around her writings.
- She did a bunch of drugs and studied altered states of consciousness, she believed she developed techniques to obtain enlightenment in record time, but also pushed the envelope in terms of what humans can do.
- She eventually killed herself, and other members of the cult followed, in what some deemed to be cult suicide, but the Prototheists believe it's just the end result of the process, the black notebook is at the center of this controversy.

I also feel like we should briefly touch upon her obsession with [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c).

I would like to have a general 'infobox' I can put at the top to note that the point of view of this article is disputed.

It's important to really sell this story in the first section, but I suspect I'm editing while writing again and condensing it too much.
We're basing the intro format on a lot of Wikipedia articles and there's no reason we can't go longer than three main paragraphs if we want.

Skyshale was an American cult leader, essayist, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), autodidact, polymath, and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) best known as the controversial founder of Prototheism, Frame Theory, for her research into ego-dissolution and other altered forms of consciousness.
A talented and prolific author, Skyshale developed an extensive collection of research notes, essays, and manuscripts, codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals which remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Through her research into meditation and psychedelic drug use Skyshale pioneered several techniques for radically augmenting human consciousness.
Through the use of carefully-selected psychoactive compounds, Skyshale believed those who followed her protocol could 'leap-frog' through their meditative practice, condensing what might be years of decades of intense daily [Vipassanā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) into mere months to achieve classical Buddhist enlightenment.

Her life and death was marked by controversy.
Her suicide has been repeated replicated by other Prototheists who have read her work in what critics have called copycat cult suicides.
Prototheists claim such suicides are the inevitable consequence of fully vanquishing the root delusion.
The infamous 'black notebook' remains a centerpiece of this controversy.

# Criticism
## Allegations of scientific racism
[todo]
We expand this by mentioning that these allegations are made despite the fact that she had an African-American boyfriend, Kenrick Valler, who would go on to found CDF.
[/todo]

Some criticize Skyshale for what they regard as racist comments regarding her tentative assertion that there are biological factors for intelligence between gender and ethnicity.

When I first start working on this article I found myself having a lot of trouble with these first few paragraphs, constantly writing and re-arranging them with that kind of timidness that plagues a lot of novices writers.

I believe that kind of obsessive perfectionism can be useful, in fact I built the wiki around the concept of never-ending updates, but it can also prevent you from getting anything done.

I have to stop and remind myself that I need to actually put something down before I edit it.
It's why I can only write on my phone or long-hand.
Having access to the backspace button is just too tempting, it kills my workflow.

There are three main concepts we want to sell in this initial splash section:

- Skyshale was a polymath and wrote extensively, a cult formed around her writings.
- She did a bunch of drugs and studied altered states of consciousness, she believed she developed techniques to obtain enlightenment in record time, but also pushed the envelope in terms of what humans can do.
- She eventually killed herself, and other members of the cult followed, in what some deemed to be cult suicide, but the Prototheists believe it's just the end result of the process, the black notebook is at the center of this controversy.

EIt's important to really sell this story in the first section, but I suspect I'm editing while writing again and condensing it too much.
We're basing the intro format on a lot of Wikipedia articles and there's no reason we can't go longer than three main paragraphs if we want.

Skyshale was an American cult leader, essayist, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), autodidact, polymath, and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) best known as the controversial founder of Prototheism as well as for her research into ego-dissolution and other altered forms of consciousness.
A talented and prolific author, Skyshale developed an extensive collection of research notes, essays, and manuscripts, codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals which remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Skyshale was an American cult leader, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat).
She is most well-known for establishing the [new religious movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_religious_movement) known as Prototheism and for her expansive collection of written works, almost of all of which were codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals she kept until her death.

Skyshale's research notes concern the study and manipulation of altered forms of consciousness.
Using a combination of intense meditation and psychoactive drug use, Skyshale claims to have developed a procedure for achieving classical Buddhist enlightenment.
Other controversial claims include techniques for inducing the formation of separate sentient personalities as well as full control or even abolition of human emotion.

Her legacy includes pioneering essays on [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization), [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) and hypothetical systems of [e-government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-government).
Skyshale was a well-known contributor to [Less Wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong) and [Dharma Overground](https://www.dharmaoverground.org), she was one of the founding developers of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page).

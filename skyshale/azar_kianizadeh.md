<!-- In the second draft let's go ahead and name her Azar in this, unlike the other articles. -->
<!-- In the initial heading describing Skyshale along with cult leader we also state she was a social critic.
We say she is diseased and that her writings spawned the religion of Prototheism rather than she created it. -->
<!-- In the third draft of the opening splash, let's be sure to make reference to her obsession with the self-immolation of [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c). -->

<!-- In the rewrite we mention in this splash section that Skyshale claimed to posses many advanced abilities before her death, including the ability to experience ego death from a sober state at will.
We note ambiguously that some of these claims have been verified. -->
<!-- We mention somewhere that as a party trick she would demonstrate being able to boil water in a pot on her hand as well as recite the dialogue to some of her favorite video games (like Halo, which she played non stop in her brother's room growing up) by heart, challenging people to name certain scenes, and later, more advanced challenges like "Start reading from the fifty-third line of non-player dialogue in the fifth chapter, who is speaking and what do they say? -->
Azar Kianizadeh was an American cult leader, essayist, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), futurist, furry, autodidact, polymath, and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) best known as the controversial founder of Prototheism, Frame Theory, for her research into ego-dissolution and other altered forms of consciousness.
In Prototheist circles she is better known by her online handle, Skyshale.
A talented and prolific author, Azar developed an extensive collection of research notes, essays, and manuscripts, codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals which remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Through her research into meditation and psychedelic drug use Azar pioneered several techniques for radically augmenting human consciousness.
Through the use of carefully-selected psychoactive compounds, Azar believed those who followed her protocol could 'leap-frog' through their meditative practice, condensing what might be years of decades of intense daily [Vipassanā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) into mere months to achieve classical Buddhist enlightenment.

Skyshale's life and death has been marked by controversy.
Her suicide has been repeated replicated by other Prototheists who have read her work in what critics have called copycat cult suicides.
Prototheists claim such suicides are the inevitable consequence of fully vanquishing the root delusion.
The infamous 'black notebook' remains a centerpiece of this debate.

# Family and childhood
<!-- See also: Kianizadeh family -->
<!-- Let's not forget the miscarriage bit in draft three. -->
Azar Kianizadeh was born in Denver, Colorado, on January 6th, 1997 into a family of first-generation Iranian emigrants.
A decade prior, her father, the famous Persian novelist [Rahim Kianizadeh](rahim_kianizadeh.md) was granted asylum by the United States in response to political prosecution by the Islamic Republic of Iran for purported counter-revolutionary sedition.
He fled the Iranian government with his wife, [Farnaz Kianizadeh](farnaz_kianizadeh.md), and their then-infant son, [Mehdi Kianizadeh](mehdi_kianizadeh.md).

Her family life was marked by instability.
They moved frequently, with Azar attending eight different schools before fifth grade, before finally purchasing a house in [Hillsborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough,_North_Carolina), North Carolina.
Money was a frequent topic of concern during Azar's childhood, with her parents having daily arguments about the family's finances.
Despite no longer being able to publish in his native country, Rahim Kianizadeh famously refused to have his works translated into English, believing any translations would rob them of their "essential essence".
An alcoholic and possible sociopath, Rahim was verbally, physically, and sexually abusive to his family.
However Azar never the darker sides of her father growing up, leading her to have a very different interpretation of Rahim compared to the rest of the family.
In her personal diaries she recalled fond memories of waiting for her father to come out of his office.
Before dinner she would give him her short stories to read and he would critique them.
<!-- We want to expand upon this, perhaps on Rahim's page, he's actually pretty critical of everything she wrote and never pulled punches, but she respected him for that. -->

<!-- Can we give a specific reason Skyshale cites for the loss of her belief in God?
Maybe something bad happened and she asked her mother and was given an unsatisfactory answer.
And in a quote she can say this is when she realized that her mother was full of it, that Islam was as fake as all the other religions.
She was filled with sorrow.
Not because she realized God didn't exist.
But because her mother was so blind, she realized even she, a pre-teen, could see through the illusion.
She thought there was something pathetic in a grown woman still believing in imaginary friends, and felt sorry for her. -->
Azar's mother, Farnaz, was diagnosed as type II bipolar, and spent much of Azar's childhood hospitalized in psychiatric wards.
A Islamic fundamentalist, Farnaz claimed to have met God during a near-death experience and during her manic episodes would tell Azar that she was a profit of God as well, which would frighten the young girl.
Azar claims that she lost her belief in God at an early age, only pretending to be a Muslim for her mother's sake.

Farnaz kept a collection of journals and would spend each morning writing in them, a habit Azar inherited.
These two collections, that of Azar and her mother, paint a sometimes radically conflicting view of the domestic lives of the Kianizadeh family, the ultimate truth of which is still a matter of dispute.

Both Azar and her older brother, Mehdi, presented severe behavioral issues as children.
Azar was described by her teachers and peers as a very gifted, albeit unruly, child.
Starting in kindergarten, she was frequently expelled from school for her outbursts, such as biting other students, although her grades were often the highest in the class.
Azar engaged in an obsessive pursuit of her hobbies.
She would pick up a new hobby, such as drawing, and quickly gain competence in it, practicing the moment she arrived home until her bed time, only to get bored after a few weeks and drop it for a different hobby.
In retrospect, many have noted that Azar displayed many traits associated with [Asperger's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome) such as her difficulty maintaining eye contact when communicating with her peers.

Both Azar and her brother were medicated from a young age, a decision she would harshly criticize later in life.
> My parents put me on Dexedrine and Lithium when I was three years old.
> Who the fuck prescribes a toddler Lithium?
> My parents and that [quack doctor](skyshale's_psychiatrist.md) put my brother and me on drugs to control us.
> It was a big problem in the 90s, you can watch documentaries on it.
> Just another couple of kids who grew up receiving pills instead of hugs.
> - Azar Kianizadeh (Skyshale conversation logs \[Vanilla Archive\])

## Early interest in altered states and initial online presence
Azar spent most of her time in the home in her brother's room.
Playing video games, writing in her journals, or using his computer.
It was through the Internet that she discovered [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) in fourth grade and was determined to have lucid dreams of her own.
She quickly mastered the [WBTB](https://lucid.fandom.com/wiki/Wake_Back_To_Bed) technique and over the next several months she gained enough skill to recall three to four lucid dreams a week.
She co-authored several still-popular tutorials on lucid dreaming under the username "Skyshale", eventually becoming a moderator on the [Dream Views](https://www.dreamviews.com) message board.
This was a frequent source of amusement between Azar and her brother, as she was only nine years old at the time.

## Father's death
<!-- Maybe before this we can include sections about her relationship with all her family members, it would be interesting if we re-include that quote, she can say her father had a beard, kind of like Jesus, except instead of turning water into wine he transmuted hard liquor into domestic violence. -->
<!-- Let's start out with a date and cause of his death, we should mention earlier that her brother was frequently gone when her father showed up, probably in an earlier section and we can allude to him being molested by his father from a young ago, but not actually say it, instead having some kind of ambiguous link back to the brother's article page. -->
<!-- In draft three we insert another paragraph here which goes into detail regarding her father's death, nature of his death, and date/time of his death, as well as the whole shit-show with her mother not getting in anything in the will and the deal with them arguing about him putting something in the will, life insurance, etc. -->

<!-- I think in draft three the below should be a journal entry from Skyshale, she talks about how she started bringing it up to the point of it being another topic for them to fight about, but when it was all said and done, her mother got nearly nothing, with his copyrights going to Skyshale once she reached adulthood.
Her mother was furious.
Actually it probably makes more sense for Skyshale to talk about her mother's happiness, as if her husband didn't just die, to her coming home one day and being pissy at Skyshale, and then for her to later find out that she got everything in the inheritance, nothing for her brother or mother. -->
Azar's relationship with her mother deteriorated further after her father's death.
Azar suspected her father was murdered and that her mother was the most likely culprit.
In the months before her father's death, Farnaz began to bring up the topic of life insurance and leaving a will.
After Rahim died Farnaz discovered that he left everything to Azar once she reached adulthood, to her mother's ire.

Once Farnaz came across one of Azar's notebooks of short stories and began reading them.
Farnaz was delighted, seeing in her daughter the same natural talent as her late husband.
A few days later Azar was called into the principal's office with her mother and an English teacher present.
They considered her writing to be at university-level and urged her to submit her stories for publication.
Azar merely nodded and thanked them for the compliments, asking for the notebooks back while saying she would consider it.
That night Farnaz found her daughter by the fireplace, she had the notebooks of stories and the rest of her remaining journals.
She was grounded for a month, when asked about why she did it, Azar replied that they weren't for her mother to read.

Azar would continue her journaling in secret, hiding her new notebooks and encoding them in [Elian Script](https://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html) so her mother couldn't read them if they were ever found.
She would only ever share her stories with her brother, sitting on his bed for hours and narrating from her notebook while he did his homework.

## Brother's suicide and spiraling depression
Mahdi Kianizadeh was undoubtedly the closest person in Azar's life during these early years, and her relationship with her brother was possibly the closest social bond she would ever have.
They only grew closer after Rahim's death.
However Mahdi was tormented by his own personal demons and on October 31st 2012 he silenced them permanently with a bullet to the brain.
He was sixteen years old.
Azar was eleven..
<!-- The dates are off, we need to figure out what their ages are and fixes the chronology accordingly. -->
<!-- Was Skyshale the one who discovered him?
Maybe she mentions it in an upcoming quote.
She can even say her mother was to cowardly to go in there, but they both knew what happened.
Maybe she says she knew something was off, he was moody all day, maybe because of all the kids trick-or-treating, we were never taken trick-or-treating. -->
In his suicide note he referenced the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and his own fears that he would grow up to be a child molester as motivations.
Even after obtaining arhatship Azar wrote in her journals that she never really recovered from her brother's death.
She was devastated by the loss and felt immense guilt that Mahdi didn't trust her enough to confide in her.
<!-- In the next draft maybe mention here that her brother's death / shame influence her controversial opinions on sexuality (and then link to that page) -->

Azar secluded herself, rarely speaking unless spoken to.
Her mother refused to talk about Mahdi after his death.
Why Azar saw her mother as cold and possibly sociopathic during this time, Farnaz's own journal entries show a woman grief-stricken by the death of her son.

One day a boy she knew at school invited her to his house, noticing how depressed she had become.
They sat in his room and smoked marijuana while Azar talked about the death of her brother, she began to cry.
In her journal she noted it was the first time she felt like she could talk to anyone about how she felt.
It also marked her first introduction to recreational drug use, in fifth grade at the age of twelve.

## Recreational drug use and declining academic performance
Drug use back Azar's latest hobby and she obsessed over it like she did her previous ones.
She began writing on marijuana, analyzing the way it changed her sense of color and taste, and experimenting with different dosages, determining that it made her more creative when writing, although she was frustrated by cannabis' intoxicating effects.
These early journal entries show the sort of scientific scrutiny she would employ going forward, with detailed logs of dosages, time spans, and subjective effects.

She quickly moved from weed to harder drugs, making new friends to make new connections as she entered middle school.
She began dating a boy who introduced her to alprazolam and hydromorphone through his older brother.
Having lost interest in school, her academic performance began to decline, to the alarm of her mother who did approve of her daughter's new friends.

> It was ridiculous.
> My mother thought I had stopped paying attention to school because I discovered drugs.
> I stopped paying attention to school because I was fucking depressed.
> The drug use was a symptom, not a cause.
> Sometimes I even ate random pills I found on the street, hoping they'd either get me high or kill me.
> I know that sounds insane, just like it sounds insane to do opioids as a pre-teen.
> But at that point I was willing to get addicted to anything that distracted me from the fact that I exist.
> -- Skyshale (Vanilla Mailing List \[Social\])

<!-- Shall we include that quote where she feels sorry about that boy she was dating and just used for drugs?
Maybe she even says it was basically like trading blow jobs for controlled substances.
She can say she didn't really care about these people, she would make friends with anyone who could supply her with drugs. -->
<!-- We mention that she sneaked out to spend the weekend at his guy's house, we also mention that (maybe in a quote) she really only hung out with her friends for drugs and kind of feels bad about using her boyfriend that way, saying that he was just a horny 14 year old who's dick she occasionally sucked in order for him to supply her with drugs from his big brother (the whole family was rich). -->

<!-- In draft three, let's come up with a name for this boyfriend, and a stub article for him.
We can include the quote in the stub article. -->

## LSD and spiritual awakening
One evening, while his father was out of town, Azar helped her boyfriend steal a tank of nitrous from his father's dental office.
Azar and a group of friends spent the night at his house, taking turns huffing the tank.
A member of the group offered Azar a tab of LSD, which was a drug unfamiliar to her, and she took it without a second thought.
In her journal Azar on that night as sparking a spiritual revelation.

> I found peace.
> A peace that was so peaceful that I couldn't have even conceptualized how at peace I could be before I found it.
> I was completely at peace with any event happening anywhere in the universe.
> I had already done all the drugs.
> I spent hours lounging in the blissful apathy of heroin, or grinding my teeth from almost painfully euphoric dosages of MDMA.
> But this was different.
> The source of my equanimity wasn't some overwhelming sense of euphoria, it was a shift in perspective.
> Like stepping outside of myself and seeing things for how they really were.
> Suddenly I knew, on a fundamental level, that I was completely integrated with the rest of the universe.
> The independent me, that I thought of me, was just a projection, something illusory.
> And because there was no me, there could be no suffering.
> My mother used to ramble for hours about her near death experience, how life changing it was, I always thought it was so ridiculous, having your life defined by a single experience.
> Know I know what it's like.
> I held spiritual revelation in my hand, literally, and unlike her I could experience it whenever I wanted.
> I knew I had to understand it.
> I knew I wanted to share it with the world.
> That morning, while everyone else was passed out, I climbed on the roof of the house and watched the sun rise.
> And it was the most beautiful sunrise I had ever seen.
> I knew my life would never be the same again.
> Nothing had changed but everything was different.
> -- Skyshale (Vanilla Mailing List \[Social\])

<!-- When we revise that above quote in the third draft, maybe mention the experience gave her a reason to live, she knew she wanted to feel that way all the time. -->
<!-- Ego dissolution should be its own article under Prototheist concepts, and we can talk about the difference interpretations of it, ego death, nirvana, etc. -->
What Azar had experienced was ego-dissolution, a phenomenon she would study for the rest of her life.
She quickly made the connection between the phenomenon she experienced and states of ego dissolution caused by meditation and began to research the subject ravenously, dropping her non-psychedelic drug use.

This new hobby took up most of her time and her grades continued to suffer.
By the time she entered High school Azar was spending most of her time away from home with friends.
She would often not see her mother for several days at a time.

## Family fallout and legal emancipation
When Azar turned fourteen her Farnaz asked her daughter what she wanted for her birthday.
Azar told her mother she wanted to "talk about Rahim."
This led to Farnaz storming out of the house, with Azar celebrating her fourteenth birthday alone.
Deciding to investigate her brother's death on her own, Azar request Rahim's medical records, posing as her mother on the phone.
She discovered that her mother, on the advice of the family's psychiatrist, had enrolled her son into a controversial sexual-orientation conversion therapy.
Azar was livid, storming into her mother's bedroom and accusing her of causing her son's suicide.
The resulting argument turned into a physical altercation, and Azar would later provide photographs of her bruises as evidence in court.
Farnaz told her daughter that as long as she lived in this house, she was to obey her mother's wishes, and that if she wanted to live her own life she could leave.
Azar reportedly responded only "We'll see about that."

Azar would spend the next two months living at a friend's house, petitioning the local family court to proclaim her an emancipated minor.
The court granted her request and on July 2nd, 2016, Azar returned home to evict her mother from what was now legally her property.
With her mother gone, Skyshale lived alone, using money she saved from summer jobs to pay for food and utilities while she continued to attend High school.

<!-- In the next draft we should mention her being expelled from High school for her heroin documentary. -->


# PsychonautWiki and growing online following
<!-- Under core contributor let's make a link to her user page on PsychonautWiki. -->
Azar would continue to live her father's house until her death, occasionally renting out the spare rooms for additional income.
Her online presence was quickly growing as she continued posting her thoughts on psychedelics and ego dissolution.
She discovered the blog Disregard Everything I Say and through it, the online encyclopedia PsychonautWiki, and became a core contributor to the site.
Her blog posts gained the interests of Dharma Overground, leading her to become a popular poster on the forum.
It was through these interactions that she first met many of her most devoted followers, including [Kenrick Valler](kenrick_valler.md), who began to live with her after a heated exchange regarding the nature of [arhatship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat).

# Further research and growing cult following
Skyshale's research diverged further from psychedelic use and towards different forms of meditation.
She began meditating for up to twelve hours a day, leading to concern from some of her close friends.
At the same time her online presence was growing, with multiple online followers living with her including her newly-wed wife, [Tsukitei Endo](collectives/vanilla/tsukitei_endo.md).

Skyshale began investigating [tulpamancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa), creating two tulpas, Alfa and Bravo, and publishing her experience with the phenomenon as articles on [tulpa.info](https://community.tulpa.info/).

After her twelve vipassanā cycle, she declared herself an arhat who had completed the path to enlightenment.
However she was still unsatisfied, and began experimenting techniques to shorten the length of a standard a standard vipassanā cycle with the goal of obtaining ego death on demand.

## The rise of Prototheism
Azar frequently criticized modern religions, especially Islam.
She began writing about what she considered a modern religion for a scientific age, based upon effective altruism and personal enlightenment.
She called this religion Mantleism, but it would eventually become known as Prototheism.
Skyshale would write two unfinished manuscripts regarding this new religion, The Mantle and The Standard Framework.

She continued to refine her techniques for obtaining ego death, with and without psychoactive drugs, and in 2017 developed the first draft of the Zebulon Protocol.

## Further research and community fractures
<!-- Since we need to mention OpenCog for this section, let's split it into a section before this, where we talk about her research and various open source project contributions, and her participations in local coops with Kenrick (paving the way for Kenrick to start CDF in Austin, which he moved to because (as we show in a quote on his user page) he was drawn to Rosewood (and maybe lived there for a bit when he first moved out, explaining that there are a lot of good things about Austin, the coop scene, and that Austin is the birthplace of the Rosewood Transmissions). -->
<!-- Really I think this should be the third sub-header under her biography, she's starting to lose herself, becoming obsessed with OpenCog and that DMT entity of hers. -->
<!-- We need a few introductory paragraphs to explain what the hell the jhanas are and the siddhis, probably include a see also to the section of the jhana article about the fourth jhana. -->
<!-- Maybe also a "See Also" that links to the controversy on one of the Prototheist pages talking about how many Prototheists believe she lost her mind at this point and that her writings are no longer valid. -->
<!-- In the rewrite let's also try including a quote by some famous Prototheist talking about how she just lost it, the rationality and skepticism she carried around with her just evaporated. Although as we mention in this section this is disputed. -->
<!-- DSI^3 of course has his own page which we do a See Also to after we split this into two sections. -->
<!-- In the further research part (or in the previous section, which is really where most of this should go) we talk about her creating Frame Theory. -->
After mastering tulpas, lucid dreaming, and samatha and vipassanā meditation, Skyshale began to explore the hallucinatory landscape of the fourth jhana, which is a meditate state known for presenting seemingly supernatural experiences, otherwise known as 'siddhis'.
Inspired by the writing of Daniel Ingram (and wishing to disprove his assertions), Skyshale investigating the siddhis through deep kasina meditation.
This marks a controversy in Prototheism that persists to this day as many Prototheists believe Skyshale began to lose her mind.
While initially skeptical that the siddhi experiences represented anything other than hallucinations, she began to suspect that the experiences she had, and especially the DMT-like entities she encountered, were were real and that the fourth jhana allowed her to communicate with alien entities at faster than light speed.

She claimed that one entity in particular, DSI^3, would sing to her, but the song was not words, but intricate multi-dimensional hallucinations that represented abstract knowledge which would then be burned into her psyche.
Skyshale would enter this state, communicate with DSI^3, and then immediately pass out.
When she woke up she would spend hours writing in her notebooks or working on OpenCog, and claimed that DSI^3 provided the inspiration for many of OpenCog's core concepts, such as the atomspace and <!-- Figure out phrase for when an AI system explodes in complexity due to the inability to transfer the information to another agent, and of course we're going to have to eventually create an article on it. -->.

<!-- In the rewrite we talk about how she renamed her house the something compound and was able to consistently evade rules preventing so many people from living there. -->
Her claims of demonstrating supernatural abilities and seem addiction to the jhanas lead to a schism in her adherents many of them leaving the compound.

## Death
<!-- In the next draft let's expand this to mention the negative encounter she had with DSI^3. -->
<!-- We should figure out how much we want to mention about DSI^3 (or even keep it as a concept) in the second draft, we can probably include another see also heading here that links to DSI^3 and move references to her questions about the nature of the self to that particular article. -->
<!-- By the next draft let's come up with a concrete time span for all this stuff, which was she born, when did she die, when did she first do drugs, when did her brother die.
We want to include specific times especially for her death.-->
After her experience with DSI^3, Azar retreated to the east wing of her house for several weeks, stating that she was working on a new Tek and desired solitude.
This was not particularly concern as Azar often secluded herself while dedicating time to new research.
And while Azar was occasionally seen leaving her room to eat or use the restroom, none of her housemates could remember anything particularly unusual about her behavior.
She reportedly stopped to have a friendly chat with a neighbor on the morning of her death.

<!-- On the third draft let's go back and check out Woodsong (which we should read anyway because it's good) since that's what we're ripping off. -->
At approximately 2:00PM, thirteen days after her last encounter with DSI^3, Skyshale invited her house mates outside, telling them she had something important to show them.
In her back yard she thanked them for their companionship, calmly doused herself in gasoline, and self-immolated.
> Initially I was excited to see her new Tek, and finally talk to her again.
> When she thanked us, I knew something was wrong when she told us was to work out our enlightenment with diligence, parroting the last words of the Buddha.
> The last thing she said was "Kenrick, in my room there's something waiting for you."
> I didn't recognize the can of gasoline at her feet, or perhaps I just didn't think to notice it at the time.
> She picked it up, poured it on herself, and lit it all at once.
> One second she was talking to us and the next she was in flames.
> But she didn't flinch as she burned, even as the scent of burning hair and flesh was threatening to make us vomit.
> She just calmly looked between us as if we were family seeing her off on a trip.
> And when she looked at me she smiled.
> I'll never forget that smile.
> And then her eyes melted and her lips curled back and there was nothing but the smile.
> She didn't fall over.
> She just sort of sagged to her knees.
> And I think some place in the back of my mind she's still sagging there, watching me.
> Eventually I vaguely became aware of Endo coming in with a fire extinguisher.
> And my first coherent thought wasn't that I just lost my best friend and the most important person in my life.
> But: "Oh yeah, there's a fire extinguisher under the kitchen cupboard, why didn't I think of that?"
> I looked around at the rest of the group and the other's expressions held the same unreal horror and confusion as mine.
> I think we were all waiting to wake up.
> -- Kenrick Valler (Meditations on Skyshale)

<!-- In the rewrite let's replace with the actual hospital, with a Wikipedia link if we can find one, or maybe just a map link. -->
<!-- Would it make sense for Kenrick and the others not to be able to visit her because they weren't technically family?
We can work that into Kenrick's quote, and it's the start of the growing animosity between him and Endo. -->
Azar was taken to Duke Hospital in critical condition.
She died six hours later, the cause of death was fourth degree burns covering 96% of her body.

Tsukitei Endo has more to say on her wife's death:
> I wish I had let her burn.
> In retrospect, I think that was the ultimate betrayal.
> She wanted to burn.
> She never regained consciousness in the hospital, and I'm glad she didn't.
> It was obvious by that point that even if we had managed to save her life, it wouldn't have been a life worth living.
> At her bedside all I could repeat was "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
> - Tsukitei Endo (Vanilla Mailing Archives - Social)

## Aftermath
<!-- Talk about post-sectarian Prototheism and how there were splits after her death. See also: History of Prototheism. -->
Shortly after Azar's death and investigation was launched into the motivations behind her suicide.
Kenrick was the first into her room.

> There's so much I've forgotten about that old house but I remember that room so clearly.
> I stepped into the room and was surrounded by her scent.
> Her room was completely clean, pristine in a military sense, as it always was.
> And I remember thinking that I should try to pay attention and remember the smell because eventually it would disappear.
> And all at once it hit me that she was actually dead and I was never going to see her again.
> I fell to my knees.
> I wanted to cry, but I really didn't know how anymore.
> So I just kneeled there, trying to memorize the contours of her room, the details of her scent.
> The others cried.
> A house full of self-proclaimed arhats and we were sobbing like children.
> -- Kenrick Valler (Meditations on Skyshale)

Kenrick found an envelope laying on her desk atop a notebook.
The envelope contained a personal letter to Kenrick as well as her will and a warning against the notebook's contents.

# Personal life
## Personality
While on the outside Azar presented a front of confidence and equanimity her diary entries reveal a woman who struggled with self-doubt and the lingering pain of her childhood trauma.
She often struggled with interpersonal relationships and empathy and was frequently frustrated by her inability to overcome these limitations in her nature, which became an obsession in itself.
Contemporary critics interpret many of her motivations as narcissistic, with sociopathic tendencies.
Although she appeared to recognize these traits in herself and worked towards resolving them.

<!-- ## Journaling habit -->
<!-- See also: The Skyshale Documents -->
<!-- ## Obsessiveness -->
<!-- Add some bits here. -->

<!-- Given her own abusive upbringing, she's very critical of the way people treat children, calling spanking normalized child abuse that would get you arrested if you did it to an adult. -->
<!-- She's also very critical of what she considers to be psychiatric abuse, including overmedication of patients without any sort of CBT involved. -->

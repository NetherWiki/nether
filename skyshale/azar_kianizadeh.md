[commentary]
I find by default I usually write stories about men doing things, with female characters as an afterthought.
I would to reverse that with this story, where it's mostly women who are the main characters and men are an aside.

Skyshale was an American cult leader, essayist, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), futurist, furry, autodidact, polymath, and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) best known as the controversial founder of Prototheism, Frame Theory, for her research into ego-dissolution and other altered forms of consciousness.
A talented and prolific author, Skyshale developed an extensive collection of research notes, essays, and manuscripts, codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals which remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Through her research into meditation and psychedelic drug use Skyshale pioneered several techniques for radically augmenting human consciousness.
Through the use of carefully-selected psychoactive compounds, Skyshale believed those who followed her protocol could 'leap-frog' through their meditative practice, condensing what might be years of decades of intense daily [Vipassanā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) into mere months to achieve classical Buddhist enlightenment.

Skyshale's life and death has been marked by controversy.
Her suicide has been repeated replicated by other Prototheists who have read her work in what critics have called copycat cult suicides.
Prototheists claim such suicides are the inevitable consequence of fully vanquishing the root delusion.
The infamous 'black notebook' remains a centerpiece of this debate.

# Family and childhood
<!-- See also: Kianizadeh family -->
<!-- She should probably have been born somewhere else, the family constantly moved on a whim -->
Azar Kianizadeh was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on January 6th, 1997 into a family of first-generation Iranian emigrants.
A decade prior her father, the famous Persian novelist [Rahim](rahim_kianizadeh.md) was granted asylum by the United States in response to political prosecution by the Islamic Republic of Iran for purported counter-revolutionary sedition.
He fled the Iranian government with his wife, [Farnaz Kianizadeh](farnaz_kianizadeh.md), and their then-infant son, [Mehdi Kianizadeh](mehdi_kianizadeh.md).

The Kianizadeh family moved frequently, Azar attended eight different elementary schools before seventh grade.
Her family life was marked by instability.
Her parents fought constantly and bankruptcy was always a looming threat.
Her father famously refused to have his works translated into English, believing Persian to be a superior language, despite no longer being able to sell his work in Iran.
An alcoholic and possible sociopath, Rahim was verbally, physically, and sexually abusive to his family.
Her mother, Farnaz, was diagnosed with bipolar type II, and was frequently hospitalized in psychiatric wards.
A Islamic fundamentalist, Farnaz claimed to have met God during a near-death experience.

<!-- In the revision perhaps she concludes something like "Just another couple of kids who grew up receiving pills instead of hugs. (And she references this in the context of the 90s scandal of overmedication.) (We mention later on she's very critical of what she perceives as overmedication in psychiatry as well as what she considers 'normalized child abuse' like spanking and the other shitty ways people treat their children but would never treat an adult.)-->
Azar was described as a very gifted child by her teachers, albeit one with severe behavioral issues.
Starting in kindergarten she was frequently expelled in schools for bad behavior.
She was known for obsessive hobbies.
She would pick up something, such as drawing, and work on it
In retrospect Azar displayed many traits associated with childhood autism, including the inability to maintain social connections with her peers.
Start from a young age Azar was treated with anti-depressants and ADHD medication, a decision she would harshly criticize later in life:
> My parents put me on Dexedrine and Lithium when I was three years old.
> Who in their right mind gives a toddler Lithium?
> My parents and that [quack doctor](skyshale's_psychiatrist.md) put us \[Azar and her brother Mehdi\] on drugs to control us.
> It was a big problem in the 90s, you can watch documentaries on it.
> Just another couple of kids who grew up receiving pills instead of hugs.

## Early interest in altered states
Skyshale took up [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) in grade school, quickly mastering the [WBTB](https://lucid.fandom.com/wiki/Wake_Back_To_Bed) technique and becoming a regular contributor online lucid dreaming communities.
She co-authored several still-popular lucid dreaming tutorials, later reflecting how interesting it was that nobody knew they were being written by a pre-teen.

## Father's death
Skyshale's relationship with her mother grew strained after her father's death.
Skyshale believed her father was murdered and that her mother was the likely culprit, suspecting her mother of wanting to inherit his property, which he left entirely to Azar.
After after father's death, her mother, Farnaz stumbled upon some of Skyshale's notebooks of short stories.
Farnaz was delighted, believing her daughter shared her father's talent for fiction.
Skyshale found out when her mother and teacher sat down with her at school, complimenting her stories and urging her to publish them.
Azar politely thanked them both, asked for the notebooks back, and said she would consider it.
That night Farnaz found her daughter by the fireplace, burning the notebooks and all of her remaining journals.
She was grounded for several weeks during which time she refused to speak to her family.
She would later hide her later journals, encoding them in [Elian Script](https://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html) in case they were ever found.
She only shared her stories with her brother.
She would sit on his bed and narrate them to him from her notebooks.


## Brother's suicide and recreational drug abuse
<!-- Maybe we can move this to its own section? Seems like maybe there should be subsection for he recreational drug use, or maybe just death of brother and beginning of recreational drug use. -->
During her primary education, Skyshale was closest to Mehdi Kianizadeh, her brother.
His suicide shortly after her thirteenth birthday, and the corresponding revelations in his suicide note, deeply affected her.
In middle school she she was introduced to marijuana and began using it alongside other recreational drugs, which became her latest obsession.
> I did a lot of drugs as a kid.
> I wouldn't recommend it.
> But it was...interesting.
> It got to the point where I picked up random pills I found on the street and popped them hoping to get high.
> But at the time I was willing to become addicted to anything that distracted me from the fact that I existed.

<!-- We mention that she sneaked out to spend the weekend at his guy's house, we also mention that (maybe in a quote) she really only hung out with her friends for drugs and kind of feels bad about using her boyfriend that way, saying that he was just a horny 14 year old who's dick she occasionally sucked in order for him to supply her with drugs from his big brother (the whole family was rich). -->
<!-- On the rewrite we should mention that she was immediately interested in the effect on weed on her thoughts and writing and would often write fiction on it, as well as document the way her thoughts changed, but it was also intoxicating, she really starts studying weed later after LSD. -->
One evening Skyshale helped her boyfriend at the time steal a tank of nitrous from his father's office (his father was a dentist who was out for the weekend).
While gathered around the tank, taking turns huffing on it, a member of group offered Skyshale a tab of LSD, which was a drug she was unfamiliar with.
That evening Skyshale experienced a spiritual revelation.
<!-- We have a quote about her saying that nothing changed but everything was different. -->

Skyshale abandoned other drugs, focusing exclusively on psychedelics.
Skyshale took up daily meditation, writing detailed logs about her experience, and became obsessed with the self-immolation of [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c).
However Skyshale's new hobby absorbed most of her time and as a result her grades suffered, bringing further conflict with her and her mother, who did not approve of her new friends.
Skyshale spent most of her time away from home, sometimes not speaking to her mother for weeks at a time.

## Emancipation
<!-- Can you actually just request somebody's medical records on the phone? -->
Azar and her mother never spoke of Mehdi after his death, something Azar resented her mother for.
For Azar's sixteenth birthday Farnaz asked her daughter what she would like for her birthday, and Azar replied that she wanted "to talk about Rahim".
This led to Farnaz storming out of the house, leaving Azar to celebrate her birthday alone.
Azar decided to investigate her brother's death herself, requesting Rahim's medical records by posing as her mother.
She discovered that her mother, on the advice of the family's psychiatrist, had enrolled her son into a controversial sexual-orientation conversion therapy.
Azar was livid, storming into her mother's bedroom and accusing her of causing her son's suicide.
The resulting argument turned into a physical altercation, and Azar would later provide photographs of her bruises as evidence in court.
Farnaz told her daughter that as long as she lived in this house, she was to obey her mother's wishes, and that if she wanted to live her own life she could leave.
Azar reportedly responded only "We'll see about that."

Azar would spend the next two months living at a friend's house, petitioning the local family court to proclaim her an emancipated minor.
The court granted her request and on July 2nd, 2016, Azar returned home to evict her mother from what was now legally her property.
With her mother gone, Skyshale lived alone, using money she saved from summer jobs to pay for food and utilities while she continued to attend High school.

# PsychonautWiki and growing online following
Azar would continue to live her father's house until her death, occasionally renting out the spare rooms for additional income.

# Personality & opinions
## Views on intellectual property
Skyshale was fiercely critical of modern intellectual property laws, claiming that are abused by corporations to prevent competition and stifle the creation of new media, rather than encourage it.

# Criticism
## Allegations of scientific racism
[todo]
We expand this by mentioning that these allegations are made despite the fact that she had an African-American boyfriend, Kenrick Valler, who would go on to found CDF.
[/todo]

Some criticize Skyshale for what they regard as racist comments regarding her tentative assertion that there are biological factors for intelligence between gender and ethnicity.

<!-- In the second draft let's go ahead and name her Azar in this, unlike the other articles. -->
<!-- In the initial heading describing Skyshale along with cult leader we also state she was a social critic.
We say she is diseased and that her writings spawned the religion of Prototheism rather than she created it. -->

I find by default I usually write stories about men doing things, with female characters as an afterthought.
I would to reverse that with this story, where it's mostly women who are the main characters and men are an aside.

<!-- In the rewrite we mention in this splash section that Skyshale claimed to posses many advanced abilities before her death, including the ability to experience ego death from a sober state at will.
We note ambiguously that some of these claims have been verified. -->
<!-- We mention somewhere that as a party trick she would demonstrate being able to boil water in a pot on her hand as well as recite the dialogue to some of her favorite video games (like Halo, which she played non stop in her brother's room growing up) by heart, challenging people to name certain scenes, and later, more advanced challenges like "Start reading from the fifty-third line of non-player dialogue in the fifth chapter, who is speaking and what do they say? -->
Skyshale was an American cult leader, essayist, [psychonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics), futurist, furry, autodidact, polymath, and self-professed [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) best known as the controversial founder of Prototheism, Frame Theory, for her research into ego-dissolution and other altered forms of consciousness.
A talented and prolific author, Skyshale developed an extensive collection of research notes, essays, and manuscripts, codified in the hundreds of hand-written journals which remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Through her research into meditation and psychedelic drug use Skyshale pioneered several techniques for radically augmenting human consciousness.
Through the use of carefully-selected psychoactive compounds, Skyshale believed those who followed her protocol could 'leap-frog' through their meditative practice, condensing what might be years of decades of intense daily [Vipassanā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) into mere months to achieve classical Buddhist enlightenment.

Skyshale's life and death has been marked by controversy.
Her suicide has been repeated replicated by other Prototheists who have read her work in what critics have called copycat cult suicides.
Prototheists claim such suicides are the inevitable consequence of fully vanquishing the root delusion.
The infamous 'black notebook' remains a centerpiece of this debate.

# Family and childhood
<!-- See also: Kianizadeh family -->
<!-- She should probably have been born somewhere else, the family constantly moved on a whim -->
Azar Kianizadeh was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on January 6th, 1997 into a family of first-generation Iranian emigrants.
A decade prior her father, the famous Persian novelist [Rahim](rahim_kianizadeh.md) was granted asylum by the United States in response to political prosecution by the Islamic Republic of Iran for purported counter-revolutionary sedition.
He fled the Iranian government with his wife, [Farnaz Kianizadeh](farnaz_kianizadeh.md), and their then-infant son, [Mehdi Kianizadeh](mehdi_kianizadeh.md).

The Kianizadeh family moved frequently, Azar attended eight different elementary schools before seventh grade.
Her family life was marked by instability.
Her parents fought constantly and bankruptcy was always a looming threat.
Her father famously refused to have his works translated into English, believing Persian to be a superior language, despite no longer being able to sell his work in Iran.
An alcoholic and possible sociopath, Rahim was verbally, physically, and sexually abusive to his family.
Her mother, Farnaz, was diagnosed with bipolar type II, and was frequently hospitalized in psychiatric wards.
A Islamic fundamentalist, Farnaz claimed to have met God during a near-death experience.

<!-- In the revision perhaps she concludes something like "Just another couple of kids who grew up receiving pills instead of hugs. (And she references this in the context of the 90s scandal of overmedication.) (We mention later on she's very critical of what she perceives as overmedication in psychiatry as well as what she considers 'normalized child abuse' like spanking and the other shitty ways people treat their children but would never treat an adult.)-->
Azar was described as a very gifted child by her teachers, albeit one with severe behavioral issues.
Starting in kindergarten she was frequently expelled in schools for bad behavior.
She was known for obsessive hobbies.
She would pick up something, such as drawing, and work on it
In retrospect Azar displayed many traits associated with childhood autism, including the inability to maintain social connections with her peers.
Start from a young age Azar was treated with anti-depressants and ADHD medication, a decision she would harshly criticize later in life:
> My parents put me on Dexedrine and Lithium when I was three years old.
> Who in their right mind gives a toddler Lithium?
> My parents and that [quack doctor](skyshale's_psychiatrist.md) put us \[Azar and her brother Mehdi\] on drugs to control us.
> It was a big problem in the 90s, you can watch documentaries on it.
> Just another couple of kids who grew up receiving pills instead of hugs.

## Early interest in altered states
Skyshale took up [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) in grade school, quickly mastering the [WBTB](https://lucid.fandom.com/wiki/Wake_Back_To_Bed) technique and becoming a regular contributor online lucid dreaming communities.
She co-authored several still-popular lucid dreaming tutorials, later reflecting how interesting it was that nobody knew they were being written by a pre-teen.

## Father's death
Skyshale's relationship with her mother grew strained after her father's death.
Skyshale believed her father was murdered and that her mother was the likely culprit, suspecting her mother of wanting to inherit his property, which he left entirely to Azar.
After after father's death, her mother, Farnaz stumbled upon some of Skyshale's notebooks of short stories.
Farnaz was delighted, believing her daughter shared her father's talent for fiction.
Skyshale found out when her mother and teacher sat down with her at school, complimenting her stories and urging her to publish them.
Azar politely thanked them both, asked for the notebooks back, and said she would consider it.
That night Farnaz found her daughter by the fireplace, burning the notebooks and all of her remaining journals.
She was grounded for several weeks during which time she refused to speak to her family.
She would later hide her later journals, encoding them in [Elian Script](https://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html) in case they were ever found.
She only shared her stories with her brother.
She would sit on his bed and narrate them to him from her notebooks.


## Brother's suicide and recreational drug abuse
<!-- Maybe we can move this to its own section? Seems like maybe there should be subsection for he recreational drug use, or maybe just death of brother and beginning of recreational drug use. -->
<!-- In the re-write there's quote here where she says her mother thought she stopped paying attention to school because of her drug use.
That was ridiculous, she stopped paying attention to school because her brother died and she didn't want to live anymore, the drug use was a symptom not a cause.
(We can combine this with her quote about getting to a point where she ate random pills off the ground, hoping they would either get her high or kill her.
She was willing to get addicted to anything that distracted her from the fact that she existed. -->
During her primary education, Skyshale was closest to Mehdi Kianizadeh, her brother.
His suicide shortly after her thirteenth birthday, and the corresponding revelations in his suicide note, deeply affected her.
In middle school she she was introduced to marijuana and began using it alongside other recreational drugs, which became her latest obsession.
> I did a lot of drugs as a kid.
> I wouldn't recommend it.
> But it was...interesting.
> It got to the point where I picked up random pills I found on the street and popped them hoping to get high.
> But at the time I was willing to become addicted to anything that distracted me from the fact that I existed.

## LSD use and spiritual awakening
<!-- In the second draft lets mention that she is particularly obsessed with ego death and wants to understand the experience. -->
<!-- We mention that she sneaked out to spend the weekend at his guy's house, we also mention that (maybe in a quote) she really only hung out with her friends for drugs and kind of feels bad about using her boyfriend that way, saying that he was just a horny 14 year old who's dick she occasionally sucked in order for him to supply her with drugs from his big brother (the whole family was rich). -->
<!-- On the rewrite we should mention that she was immediately interested in the effect on weed on her thoughts and writing and would often write fiction on it, as well as document the way her thoughts changed, but it was also intoxicating, she really starts studying weed later after LSD. -->
One evening Skyshale helped her boyfriend at the time steal a tank of nitrous from his father's office (his father was a dentist who was out for the weekend).
While gathered around the tank, taking turns huffing on it, a member of group offered Skyshale a tab of LSD, which was a drug she was unfamiliar with.
That evening Skyshale experienced a spiritual revelation.
<!-- We have a quote about her saying that nothing changed but everything was different. -->
Skyshale abandoned other drugs, focusing exclusively on psychedelics.
Skyshale took up daily meditation, writing detailed logs about her experience, and became obsessed with the self-immolation of [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c).
However Skyshale's new hobby absorbed most of her time and as a result her grades suffered, bringing further conflict with her and her mother, who did not approve of her new friends.
Skyshale spent most of her time away from home, sometimes not speaking to her mother for weeks at a time.

## Emancipation
<!-- Can you actually just request somebody's medical records on the phone? -->
<!-- In the next draft we should mention her being expelled from High school for her heroin documentary. -->
Azar and her mother never spoke of Mehdi after his death, something Azar resented her mother for.
For Azar's sixteenth birthday Farnaz asked her daughter what she would like for her birthday, and Azar replied that she wanted "to talk about Rahim".
This led to Farnaz storming out of the house, leaving Azar to celebrate her birthday alone.
Azar decided to investigate her brother's death herself, requesting Rahim's medical records by posing as her mother.
She discovered that her mother, on the advice of the family's psychiatrist, had enrolled her son into a controversial sexual-orientation conversion therapy.
Azar was livid, storming into her mother's bedroom and accusing her of causing her son's suicide.
The resulting argument turned into a physical altercation, and Azar would later provide photographs of her bruises as evidence in court.
Farnaz told her daughter that as long as she lived in this house, she was to obey her mother's wishes, and that if she wanted to live her own life she could leave.
Azar reportedly responded only "We'll see about that."

Azar would spend the next two months living at a friend's house, petitioning the local family court to proclaim her an emancipated minor.
The court granted her request and on July 2nd, 2016, Azar returned home to evict her mother from what was now legally her property.
With her mother gone, Skyshale lived alone, using money she saved from summer jobs to pay for food and utilities while she continued to attend High school.

# PsychonautWiki and growing online following
<!-- Under core contributor let's make a link to her user page on PsychonautWiki. -->
Azar would continue to live her father's house until her death, occasionally renting out the spare rooms for additional income.
Her online presence was quickly growing as she continued posting her thoughts on psychedelics and ego dissolution.
She discovered the blog Disregard Everything I Say and through it, the online encyclopedia PsychonautWiki, and became a core contributor to the site.
Her blog posts gained the interests of Dharma Overground, leading her to become a popular poster on the forum.
It was through these interactions that she first met many of her most devoted followers, including [Kenrick Valler](kenrick_valler.md), who began to live with her after a heated exchange regarding the nature of [arhatship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat).

# Further research and growing cult following
Skyshale's research diverged further from psychedelic use and towards different forms of meditation.
She began meditating for up to twelve hours a day, leading to concern from some of her close friends.
At the same time her online presence was growing, with multiple online followers living with her including her newly-wed wife, [Tsukitei Endo](collectives/vanilla/tsukitei_endo.md).

Skyshale began investigating [tulpamancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa), creating two tulpas, Alfa and Bravo, and publishing her experience with the phenomenon as articles on [tulpa.info](https://community.tulpa.info/).

After her twelve vipassanā cycle, she declared herself an arhat who had completed the path to enlightenment.
However she was still unsatisfied, and began experimenting techniques to shorten the length of a standard a standard vipassanā cycle with the goal of obtaining ego death on demand.

## The rise of Prototheism
Azar frequently criticized modern religions, especially Islam.
She began writing about what she considered a modern religion for a scientific age, based upon effective altruism and personal enlightenment.
She called this religion Mantleism, but it would eventually become known as Prototheism.
Skyshale would write two unfinished manuscripts regarding this new religion, The Mantle and The Standard Framework.

She continued to refine her techniques for obtaining ego death, with and without psychoactive drugs, and in 2017 developed the first draft of the Zebulon Protocol.

## Further research and community fractures
<!-- Since we need to mention OpenCog for this section, let's split it into a section before this, where we talk about her research and various open source project contributions, and her participations in local coops with Kenrick (paving the way for Kenrick to start CDF in Austin, which he moved to because (as we show in a quote on his user page) he was drawn to Rosewood (and maybe lived there for a bit when he first moved out, explaining that there are a lot of good things about Austin, the coop scene, and that Austin is the birthplace of the Rosewood Transmissions). -->
<!-- Really I think this should be the third sub-header under her biography, she's starting to lose herself, becoming obsessed with OpenCog and that DMT entity of hers. -->
<!-- We need a few introductory paragraphs to explain what the hell the jhanas are and the siddhis, probably include a see also to the section of the jhana article about the fourth jhana. -->
<!-- Maybe also a "See Also" that links to the controversy on one of the Prototheist pages talking about how many Prototheists believe she lost her mind at this point and that her writings are no longer valid. -->
<!-- In the rewrite let's also try including a quote by some famous Prototheist talking about how she just lost it, the rationality and skepticism she carried around with her just evaporated. Although as we mention in this section this is disputed. -->
<!-- DSI^3 of course has his own page which we do a See Also to after we split this into two sections. -->
<!-- In the further research part (or in the previous section, which is really where most of this should go) we talk about her creating Frame Theory. -->
After mastering tulpas, lucid dreaming, and samatha and vipassanā meditation, Skyshale began to explore the hallucinatory landscape of the fourth jhana, which is a meditate state known for presenting seemingly supernatural experiences, otherwise known as 'siddhis'.
Inspired by the writing of Daniel Ingram (and wishing to disprove his assertions), Skyshale investigating the siddhis through deep kasina meditation.
This marks a controversy in Prototheism that persists to this day as many Prototheists believe Skyshale began to lose her mind.
While initially skeptical that the siddhi experiences represented anything other than hallucinations, she began to suspect that the experiences she had, and especially the DMT-like entities she encountered, were were real and that the fourth jhana allowed her to communicate with alien entities at faster than light speed.

She claimed that one entity in particular, DSI^3, would sing to her, but the song was not words, but intricate multi-dimensional hallucinations that represented abstract knowledge which would then be burned into her psyche.
Skyshale would enter this state, communicate with DSI^3, and then immediately pass out.
When she woke up she would spend hours writing in her notebooks or working on OpenCog, and claimed that DSI^3 provided the inspiration for many of OpenCog's core concepts, such as the atomspace and <!-- Figure out phrase for when an AI system explodes in complexity due to the inability to transfer the information to another agent, and of course we're going to have to eventually create an article on it. -->.

<!-- In the rewrite we talk about how she renamed her house the something compound and was able to consistently evade rules preventing so many people from living there. -->
Her claims of demonstrating supernatural abilities and seem addiction to the jhanas lead to a schism in her adherents many of them leaving the compound.

## Death
<!-- In the next draft let's expand this to mention the negative encounter she had with DSI^3. -->
<!-- We should figure out how much we want to mention about DSI^3 (or even keep it as a concept) in the second draft, we can probably include another see also heading here that links to DSI^3 and move references to her questions about the nature of the self to that particular article. -->
<!-- By the next draft let's come up with a concrete time span for all this stuff, which was she born, when did she die, when did she first do drugs, when did her brother die.
We want to include specific times especially for her death.-->
After her experience with DSI^3, Azar retreated to the east wing of her house for several weeks, stating that she was working on a new Tek and desired solitude.
This was not particularly concern as Azar often secluded herself while dedicating time to new research.
And while Azar was occasionally seen leaving her room to eat or use the restroom, none of her housemates could remember anything particularly unusual about her behavior.
She reportedly stopped to have a friendly chat with a neighbor on the morning of her death.

<!-- On the third draft let's go back and check out Woodsong (which we should read anyway because it's good) since that's what we're ripping off. -->
At approximately 2:00PM, thirteen days after her last encounter with DSI^3, Skyshale invited her house mates outside, telling them she had something important to show them.
In her back yard she thanked them for their companionship, calmly doused herself in gasoline, and self-immolated.
> Initially I was excited to see her new Tek, and finally talk to her again.
> When she thanked us, I knew something was wrong when she told us was to work out our enlightenment with diligence, parroting the last words of the Buddha.
> The last thing she said was "Kenrick, in my room there's something waiting for you."
> I didn't recognize the can of gasoline at her feet, or perhaps I just didn't think to notice it at the time.
> She picked it up, poured it on herself, and lit it all at once.
> One second she was talking to us and the next she was in flames.
> But she didn't flinch as she burned, even as the scent of burning hair and flesh was threatening to make us vomit.
> She just calmly looked between us as if we were family seeing her off on a trip.
> And when she looked at me she smiled.
> I'll never forget that smile.
> And then her eyes melted and her lips curled back and there was nothing but the smile.
> She didn't fall over.
> She just sort of sagged to her knees.
> And I think some place in the back of my mind she's still sagging there, watching me.
> Eventually I vaguely became aware of Endo coming in with a fire extinguisher.
> And my first coherent thought wasn't that I just lost my best friend and the most important person in my life.
> But: "Oh yeah, there's a fire extinguisher under the kitchen cupboard, why didn't I think of that?"
> I looked around at the rest of the group and the other's expressions held the same unreal horror and confusion as mine.
> I think we were all waiting to wake up.
> -- Kenrick Valler (Meditations on Skyshale)

<!-- In the rewrite let's replace with the actual hospital, with a Wikipedia link if we can find one, or maybe just a map link. -->
<!-- Would it make sense for Kenrick and the others not to be able to visit her because they weren't technically family?
We can work that into Kenrick's quote, and it's the start of the growing animosity between him and Endo. -->
Azar was taken to Duke Hospital in critical condition.
She died six hours later, the cause of death was fourth degree burns covering 96% of her body.

Tsukitei Endo has more to say on her wife's death:
> I wish I had let her burn.
> In retrospect, I think that was the ultimate betrayal.
> She wanted to burn.
> She never regained consciousness in the hospital, and I'm glad she didn't.
> It was obvious by that point that even if we had managed to save her life, it wouldn't have been a life worth living.
> At her bedside all I could repeat was "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
> - Tsukitei Endo (Vanilla Mailing Archives - Social)

## Aftermath
<!-- Talk about post-sectarian Prototheism and how there were splits after her death. See also: History of Prototheism. -->
Shortly after Azar's death and investigation was launched into the motivations behind her suicide.
Kenrick was the first into her room.

> There's so much I've forgotten about that old house but I remember that room so clearly.
> I stepped into the room and was surrounded by her scent.
> Her room was completely clean, pristine in a military sense, as it always was.
> And I remember thinking that I should try to pay attention and remember the smell because eventually it would disappear.
> And all at once it hit me that she was actually dead and I was never going to see her again.
> I fell to my knees.
> I wanted to cry, but I really didn't know how anymore.
> So I just kneeled there, trying to memorize the contours of her room, the details of her scent.
> The others cried.
> A house full of self-proclaimed arhats and we were sobbing like children.
> -- Kenrick Valler (Meditations on Skyshale)

Kenrick found an envelope laying on her desk atop a notebook.
The envelope contained a personal letter to Kenrick as well as her will and a warning against the notebook's contents.

# Personal life
## Personality
While on the outside Azar presented a front of confidence and equanimity her diary entries reveal a woman who struggled with self-doubt and the lingering pain of her childhood trauma.
She often struggled with interpersonal relationships and empathy and was frequently frustrated by her inability to overcome these limitations in her nature, which became an obsession in itself.
Contemporary critics interpret many of her motivations as narcissistic, with sociopathic tendencies.
Although she appeared to recognize these traits in herself and worked towards resolving them.

<!-- ## Journaling habit -->
<!-- See also: The Skyshale Documents -->
<!-- ## Obsessiveness -->
<!-- Add some bits here. -->

<!-- We mention her views on religion, which might eventually become its own page, or at least her criticisms of Islam. -->
## Views on intellectual property
Skyshale was fiercely critical of modern intellectual property laws, claiming that are abused by corporations to prevent competition and stifle the creation of new media, rather than encourage it.

## Vaping industry
Skyshale often criticized the vaping industry, stating that nicotine was more difficult for her to quit than heroin, criticizing the rise of the Juul but also criticizing making 21 the legal age of smoking when you can enter the military at 18, saying it should be increased to 21.

# Criticism
## Allegations of scientific racism
Some criticize Skyshale for what they regard as racist comments regarding her tentative assertion that there are biological factors for intelligence between gender and ethnicity.

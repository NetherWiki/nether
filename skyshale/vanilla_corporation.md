One of the reasons Vanilla is so exclusive and why everyone wants to join is the money.
It has more associate members than the size of any other collective but full membership is about the size of CDF.
The Standard Framework doesn't make a distinction between 'part' and 'full' members, leading to criticism of Vanilla's practice.
But still, everyone is hoping to gain enough rapport to become a full member.
TO be a full member means free health care, unlimited travel expenses, the ability to write off your research expenses as high charity costs and get reimbursed, and a monthly stipend to cover food and housing as well as a retirement pension.
Many researchers who got grants by Vanilla are trying to become full members just so they can do their research full-time.

One critique of Vanilla is 'self-grants' where members petition Vanilla for grants that reduce suffering primarily in themselves.
(We want to mention a specific incident and then Vanilla's justification, like the McDonald's coffee lawsuit.)
For example, a long-term (or even associate) member may ask for a new house or car.
Critics have pointed to this as evidence of the commodification of rapport which they charge has led to exclusive 'clubs' of the 'rapport wealthy'.
However Vanilla defends the practice, stating that the application process for grant money has always been transparent, requests are considered by a randomized committee on a case by case basis, and rapport is just one of many factors take into consideration.
Despite this, the number of self-grants has been dwindling in recent times, with less than 500 self-grants given in 2020 despite the larger than normal requests due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many see this as a response to criticism.

We call Vanilla Corporation the 'invisible titan' much like FreeBSD is the 'unseen giant'.
They frequently fund open source work through shell companies.
The almost never directly represent themselves except to other Prototheists and purposefully keep a low profile to avoid being seen as contributing to high charity for their own sake.

(Although perhaps we should focus more on CDF keeping a low profile while keeping Vanilla as a foil.)

We explain the massive amounts of money they own as a result of early investments in cryptocurrency, having predicted a boon.
Remember, Skyshale wrote about cryptocurrency years before Bitcoin on the cypherpunk mailing list.
And many core Ethereum developers are Vanilla members.
In fact some have even suggested that Vanilla created Bitcoin (which we can list under the 'Criticism and Conspiracy Theories', along with the idea that they are basically a shadow government complete with their own supreme court whose citizens obey their own separate set of laws.)

Another criticism is that they shield their money-making division under the religious tax exemption.
In their 'transparent' financial reports they don't report all their assets either, thus nobody knows how many bitcoins they actually have or whether they were mined or donated.
Critics say if they really are a non-profit they should register as one.

That research subsidy of their is called open-something and has received criticism for some of its findings.
This can be a sub-section we may eventually develop into a separate article.

Vanilla was founded to bring about a peaceful technological singularity.

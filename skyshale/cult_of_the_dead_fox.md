We probably want to note early on that they refer to themselves as 'cultists'.
[/todo]

The Cult of the Dead Fox is a Prototheist collective based out of Austin, Texas.
Founded by Kenrick Valler after disagreements which lead to the creation of Vanilla, CDF is the second post-sectarian Prototheist collective and remains one of the better-known and most influential sects.
A hybrid between a cooperative housing organization and a Prototheist meditation center, CDF maintains a number of properties in central Austin.

# Drug use
[todo]
This should probably eventually go under the 'Beliefs' heading.
[/todo]

Like most Prototheist collectives, CDF maintains a lax position on drug use.
Many adherents defend psychedelics as a tool towards enlightenment and part of their religion, although there has been concern in recent years with members using CDF properties to traffic drugs.

# Culture
[todo]
We likely want to split the contents of this heading between 'Structure and Beliefs' and 'Culture'.

We probably want to note here their influence in the hacking and indie music and art scene and the clothing-optional nature of their properties (it should probably be more than just a passing reference).

One way to add realism is get permission to take pictures of real coops in Austin and fictionalize them as CDF properties.

Let's emphasize their CDF's interpretation of some of Skyshale's more minor points, for example they refuse to take ownership for the charity work they do.
We cite an infamous example where they were presented with an award from the city of Austin but refused to accept or acknowledge it.
We also mention that they are big attendees to NASCO.
Maybe they have a parkour and lock-picking subculture, I like the idea of regularly sponsored yearly trips to Enchanted Rock or 'real' meditation retreats.

As part of their macabre culture, they don't have signs outside their properties, they just hang a stuffed fox on a noose in front of a tree.
[/todo]

CDF is known for its emphasis on communalism and rigid adherence to the organization's interpretation of High Charity.
A common in-joke is that there are no 'casual' CDF members.
Even so CDF is known for its friendliness to outsiders.
CDF coops have become popular among university students looking for a cheaper alternative to West campus living and those interested in exploring meditation or charity works.
CDF's reputation is entirely spread by word of mouth.
Advertising and proselytizing are explicitly forbidden by the corporate charter.

## Hacker Culture
[todo]
Since we want to mention some of the weird deep learning stuff they've done (like that game idea) we probably want to make a larger sub-section for their software-based charity work below, possibly split from 'Hacker Culture'.

We note they work with Vanilla on many projects and regularly give Prototheist talks at Vanilla-sponsored conferences.
[/todo]

CDF maintains an established hacking culture in part to Kenrick's own experience as a professional penetration tester.
Like Vanilla, many cultists are contributors to open-source software.
Examples of projects with significant CDF influence includes the Linux kernel and FreeBSD project, Metasploit, HackTheBox, OpenVAS, and the nearly-released Flipper Zero.


## Memes
[todo]
We can take that fox mural and fictionalize it as being a depiction of Skyshale, we can fictionalize the other more psychedelic art as well.

After we figure out the name for the CDF chick we need to go back and mention it here.

We can move and expand this section to elaborate on the Evangelion and Land Before Time and furry porn memes.
[/todo]

CDF is known for its cynical and self-aware wit.
In-jokes and memes are commonly depicted as art on CDF properties.
CDF maintains a friendly (and arguably one-sided) rivalry with Vanilla, the latter is frequently portrayed on CDF imageboards as corporate and sterile in contrast to CDF which is depicted as organic and grass-roots.
Although this supposed rivalry hasn't stopped many grad students living in CDF coops from applying for memberships or grants at Vanilla after they graduate.

Cross-overs with Neon Genesis Evangelion are a common source of parody.
Vanilla is frequently compared to Nerv and Vanilla's intention to bring about a technological singularity likened to Third Impact and Instrumentality.
Photoshopped images of Vanilla's CEO wearing the iconic outfit of Gendo Ikari are a staple of CDF shitposting, along with anthropomorphic animal pornography and tired references to the Land Before Time series.

Another common meme is that CDF should not be mentioned to non-members (with many jokingly denying it exists) because if it goes too mainstream it will become ruined.
The second part of this joke is a reply that, in contrast, CDF has already gone mainstream and is therefore ruined.

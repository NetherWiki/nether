[todo]
We import some stuff from the original pilot article, noting that some variously see it as a secret society or shadow government or new world order or just another new hokey religion.

We can rip off the structure of the Wikipedia article on Buddhism (and other religions) for inspiration on how to structure this page, specifically how much of the PƒÅli Canon does Wikipedia reference in the main article on Buddhism?

In the splash section we mention that "Prototheism" is a registered trademark of the Vanilla Corporation.
[/todo]

Prototheism is a system of belief that is sometimes described as a religion or secular offshoot of Buddhism.
It is a rationalistic, atheistic, decentralized organization that seeks to use spiritual insight and scientific inquiry to reduce the global suffering of the human race, a concept referred to as High Charity.
Prototheism is based off the writings of Jordan Bishop, otherwise known as Skyshale.
The first Prototheist collective, Vanilla, formed shortly after her death.

# Beliefs and Bylaws
[todo]
Starts with Skyshale quote: "It's like Buddhism, but with drugs."

These sections should probably go under subheadings, possibly with a reference to 'core tenets'.
Maybe split this with general doctrines up top and High Charity down below and the associated meditation techniques and drug use to realize non-conceptual insight at the bottom.

The part about the doctrine being developed to be practical might be better placed under the history section.

Perhaps we formalize the questioning of the doctrine as a sort of ritual, or at least something people do in organizations like CDF, submitting papers or responding to mailing lists in an attempt to poke holes in, and therefore improve, Prototheist doctrine.
It is, after all, developed through committee.

One of the subheadings specifically goes into scientific reductionism and the Prototheist belief that there is no true free will.

We also mention in one of the subheading that Prototheists are moral relativists (although we mention at the top of this section that these are just shared beliefs and do not necessarily reflect all Prototheists, as the actual doctrine is quite small, at the bottom of this section we include results from a poll of beliefs at a recent Prototheist conference) and therefore feel free to ignore laws they disagree with, which generates criticism.

We mention being practical is one of the real core beliefs but we also mention at the top that much of the listed beliefs are convention and different between different sects, as The Standard Framework reads more software documentation that a religious text.

One of the subheadings can be about the Prototheist concept of self, which we mention is somewhat influenced by Buddhism and we also reference the role of non-conceptual wisdom which we elaborate on in a below section, this gives rise to Prototheist belief in the golden rule, but the reason they due on to others as they would like done to themselves is because they believe empathy should expand to all sentient beings.

If moral relativism (which we note doesn't mean they are amoral) is a subheading then we note they don't really believe in morality except as 'practical' to reduce suffering.
Assisted suicide is okay.
Heroin use is okay.
Communism is okay.
Everything is okay as long as it is practiced in a skillful and practical way.
We also mention that even the belief to reduce suffering is seen as arbitrary, but one that everyone wants, and we make reference to the root delusion and the black notebook and possibly Skyshale's suicide (maybe this can go under one of the main subheadings of 'rationality').
[/todo]

Prototheism is described as a 'rationalistic religion'.
Adherents believe there is a shared objective reality that is knowable through science.
Prototheism rejects the supernatural.
Prototheists are expected to remain skeptical and kindly question the beliefs of themselves and others.
Skyshale said that there is nothing someone should believe so strongly that they would not be willing to believe its opposite if provided with sufficient evidence to the contrary.

The purpose of Prototheism is not to gain salvation or eternal life but to reduce suffering in all sentient beings.
There is no claim of ultimate knowledge.
Prototheism teaches rationality because it is one of the most effective ways to reduce dukkha.
There is no claim of ultimate meaning.
People developed and subscribed to Prototheism simply because they do not wish to suffer.
There is no claim of the merits of self-sacrifice.
Prototheists wish to help others because they understand that the individualization of self is illusory.

Prototheist doctrine was developed to be as practical and intuitive as possible.
Prototheists are expected to question the doctrine although many of the finer points cannot be understood before gaining a certain level of non-conceptual insight.

For example: There is no concept of sin in Prototheism, certain actions are likely to cause suffering and therefore should usually be avoided.
There is no concept of karma, only the understanding that causing suffering to others is likely to cause suffering to oneself.
Because all beings are part of the same integrated universe interpreting itself subjectively, hating another person is as nonsensical as hating a part of one's body.

As there is no belief in an independent self, there can be no free will, people who seem cruel or evil are seen as simply ignorant or malfunctioning due to mental illness.

# Prototheist Teks
Prototheists develop and engage in 'teks', short for 'techniques' which refer to the skills developed to gain access to altered states of consciousness.
These teks are forms of meditation based on Skyshale's research and frequently augmented with various mental catalysts.
The teks are used for both insight and recreation and are a core part of Prototheist culture.


# Structure
[todo]
We should give some examples of differences between Prototheist collectives, some present themselves as for-profit corporations, others as religious institutions or housing projects.

Perhaps at the bottom include a table (with references of course) that show the size of members (and associate members) of the largest Prototheist collectives.
[/todo]

Prototheism is a decentralized religion structured around autonomous collectives that have the authority to reinterpret Prototheist ideology is specific ways.
Unlike for example the clash between Catholicism and Lutheranism, Prototheism explicitly allows and encourages schisms in ideology.
Inspired by the various distributions of Linux, Skyshale envisioned a religion that encouraged diversity and evolution as its core beliefs were constantly threatened via amendments.
Thus the ideology would compete against itself to adapt to the needs of a changing society.

Anybody can form a Prototheist collective.
Prototheism is a trademark held by the Vanilla Corporation and licensed to any organization that implements the requirements of the Prototheist Core Specification as originally outlined in The Standard Framework.
Officially registered Prototheist collectives are allowed to participate in inter-collective working groups that can ratify amendments to core Prototheist bylaws.

## Vanilla Corporation
Vanilla Corporation is the largest and oldest Prototheist collective.
Founded by Skyshale's wife shortly after her death, Vanilla is intended to be a reference implementation for Prototheist ideology.
The organization retains a major transhumanist slant with major grants going out to organizations like Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the OpenCog Foundation, and the SENS Research Foundation.
Vanilla's stated goal is to bring about a technological singularity in order to usher in a new era of High Charity.

## Cult of the Dead Fox
The Cult of the Dead Fox, founded by Kenrick Valler after a schism that led to the formation of Vanilla, is the second oldest Prototheist collective.
CDF believes in achieving High Charity through anonymous grassroots charitable work and achieving personal enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.

Formed as a cross between a housing coop and a meditation center, CDF adherents live communally is tenant-owned buildings.
By day they meditate to gain insight into ultimate reality and by night they engage in what has been referred to as "guerrilla charity work".
Examples include cleaning up litter or donating food, always without taking credit.
Adherents normally spend up to four hours meditating during the day in a monastery-like atmosphere.
A common in-joke is that there are no casual cultists.

## Nouveau
Nouveau is a non-public Prototheist sect that seeks High Charity through the mass-availability of psychedelic substances.
To this end they have become one of the largest distributors of controlled substances on the deep web.
They also supply tools for biohacking such as custom DNA plasmids.

## Solar Doctrine
The Solar Doctrine is an independent Prototheist group that originated from MLP-based imageboards in the aftermath of the popularization of the docs on 4chan's /x/ board.
They place an emphasis on tulpamancy and developing other Prototheist teks.


# History
[todo]
It would be great if we can eventually have a page with a table of pictures and descriptions of her 'notebooks' that we can link to, although only a few would be called 'journals'.

We have a quote from the Mantle at the top of this section: "A world without kings, a religion without God." although perhaps that would best be under the section fro the Mantle itself.

Reference Catholicism in the part about religions amending themselves.

We should begin the history section with two sub-headings.
The first is for the initial journal entries, mentioning that at the time it was known as Mantleism.
Then we follow with a section called 'Formalization' where we have possibly two more subheadings and mention The Mantle and The Standard Framework.
Then we have a section called 'Pre-sectarian Prototheism' or possibly we just jump to 'Sectarian Prototheism' or 'Post-sectarian Prototheism'.
[/todo]

The concepts that would eventually form Prototheism were originally documented in Journal 5.
In it, Skyshale began postulating about a hypothetical engineered religion, one that would best serve humanity in modern times.
Skyshale believed that many of mankind's conflicts are the result of social systems, including systems of spiritual belief, that are no longer optimal in modern times.
Religions are one of mankind's most endearing social systems.
And although religions are reinterpreted throughout time (try finding a Christian that believes in selling one's daughter into slavery) unlike governments there are no religions which have a procedure in place for amending their core beliefs.
Even when core tenets are based on beliefs that have been proven false by Science.
Thus Skyshale's proposed religion is more akin to a quasi-governmental organization than anything else.
A religion for the modern era.

Skyshale further developed this concept of synthetic religion in two unfinished manuscripts.
In The Mantle Skyshale lays out the ideological basis for Prototheism and the need for a rational, coherent, defensible form of spirituality in a society she saw as becoming nihilistic as the result of modern scientific reductionism.
In The Standard Framework Skyshale outlines the distributed nature of Prototheism (at the time known as Mantleism) and the bylaws and organization must adopt to classify itself as Prototheist.
The Standard Framework also documents which tenets of Prototheism are up to interpretation between collectives, procedures for inter-collective communication and collaboration, and the process for globally amending Prototheist doctrine.

# Criticism
[todo]
We expand this section with examples of Prototheist counter-claims to the utilitarianism comparison, mainly the Prototheist interpretation of shared-self.
The reason we don't enslave people if it reduces suffering is because we still share the suffering of those enslaved people and a society with such flagrant human rights violations would not be practical or sustainable.
The reason we don't kill people if we know we can get away with it is for the same reasons and because informed consent is necessary for a functional society.
[/todo]

Prototheist's doctrine of High Charity is often unfavorably compared to utilitarianism and is subject to many of the same criticisms.

Nimp (also known as 'egolessness', 'ego death', 'fruition', 'nirvana', or 'insight experience') is an altered state of consciousness that results in a semi-permanent reduction in the delusions associated with Inherent Bias.
Nimp is a nonsense word coined by Skyshale to avoid ambiguities regarding the terms 'ego death' and 'nirvana'.
Nimp is a transient moment of non-consciousness (note: not unconsciousness) that results in the temporary loss of subjective self-identity.
Nimp can occur at the end of a successful vipassana cycle, via various enthenogenic drugs, or through other intense life experiences.
In its meditative form it is almost always proceeded by direct realization of the three characteristics.

# Rosewood Artifacts
## Games
- An article about the original Xbox game "Braveknight", maybe that it's super creepy or something, since apparently it exists but nobody can find fucking anything out about it.
(Apparently you can enter the moon runes into YouTube to see videos of it, still...)

# Unsorted Ideas
- I would like to see if we can get somebody who actually lives at Rosewood to help make a fake coopulater we can then fictionalize on the site.
- Regarding the fake citations, there's no reason we have to host websites (which wouldn't make sense for news articles) instead we can have a link to an 'archive' which is just html in the format of these websites, which we edit to create the fake supporting articles.
People will believe it as long as the citations look professional enough.
- An article about an episode of Scare Tactics where someone who doesn't realize it's a prank ends up killing an actor.
- Maybe mention that we encourage 'plussing' in development, as mentioned here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26163982

# Unsorted Notes
- The ASK / FSK data goes into 'sleep' mode for long periods of time where only a few bytes are released per day, we can use Matplotlib to visualize this.
- Maybe go on fan wikis for books you've read (Like Drawing of the Three which you just finished) and see how abstract the plot overviews are.

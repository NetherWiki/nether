TAOCAH is a parody, not a fan-fiction.
All the characters are completely original, with only a superficial resembles to the characters in Calvin and Hobbes as a way of highlighting their differences and making a commentary on the original comic.
I know all the characters are original because I came up with them before I thought of parodying Calvin and Hobbes, back when TAOCAH was called "Justin's Story".
So if you ever hear me call this project my "Calvin and Hobbes fan-fiction", know that I'm just being facetious and taking the piss out of myself.

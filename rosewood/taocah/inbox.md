# Unsorted Notes
- At least for the Adventure Arc, we may or may not keep the idea that the school itself seems to have an effect on the students, the other kids Calvin meets change in tone dramatically depending on if they're around the school or not, but nobody but Calvin (and Hobbes) seems to notice.
- I still like the idea of Rosalyn being nineteen but still in High School, she has a meeting early on where they basically ask her to leave, telling her to get a GED and go to community college.
- What is that hat Rosalyn always wears?
Maybe a police hat?
Maybe it was her father's?
- Don't forget the homeless character is called "Rubber-band man".
- Calvin has an intense fear and hatred of hospitals or anything to do with doctors (even dentists) after his stay in the hospital.
- Maybe (big maybe, we could abandon this idea all together) at the end of the anime arc there's an epic battle which ends sort of anti-climatically.
The season wraps up and the credits roll, but afterwards there's a stinger scene where we show Calvin is happy and everything is okay.
But the stinger just keeps going and Calvin realizes the world he's living in is a lie and then the real battle happens.
- We need to think about what changes for Calvin when he keeps Hobbes at bay, what are the negative effects?
Perhaps more classical schizophrenic-like syndromes like hearing voices?
Perhaps the monster in his attic manifests partially as a result of him pushing Hobbes away, which is why Hobbes 'saves' him by abruptly switching back and pushing Calvin out of the way.
The two have to balance each other's consciousness to keep the system stable.
- When Calvin gets pissed off at Hobbes in the flashback and banishes him, he calls it a 'time out'.
- [Possible Rosalyn reference](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e0/c3/2f/e0c32f4a4bcdec3df1ba3170080dd14e.jpg), she's half Asian and specifically says that having an Asian girlfriend is an excellent investment because the skin doesn't have diminishing returns.
- Calvin is constantly chewing on his shirt, he has a bunch or ruined shirts with visible chew marks and missing buttons, it's a really bad habit of his he can't seem to get rid of until he gets addicted to nicotine.
Then whenever he tries to quit he's back to chewing his shirt, someone suggests adding hot sauce to them.
Almost all his shirts have visible chew marks on the collars and sleeves.
- Rosalyn gets Calvin a t-shirt that says “I know I’m autistic and I’m sorry.”
- Aside from mixing up his words and using the wrong ones, Calvin also (at the beginning at least) is shown to frequently skip words, like "I too am waiting to let in."
- Note that the tulpas usually share a family name with the host.
Calvin's mother was Mary Hobbes (or Alice Hobbes), Calvin got adopted so his name is Calvin Ferraro, but the tiger toy introduces himself as "Hobbes".
Calvin meets a boy named Chance, but his full name is "Christopher Chance Robyn", but the audience (and Calvin) doesn't realize he's actual a tulpa that overtook his host until Season 2.
Margo has a stuffed wolf named "Peter Wolf", Peter is also her father's name, leading to the pun when she claims the wolf is murdering people around town but she's really feeding them to her father after he loses his mind.
(Not sure what the pun is with Susie or if we need one.)
- Rosalyn smokes cigarettes at the beginning of the show, it is Calvin who gets her a Juul or whatever Juul-clone she uses as a gift.

# Unsorted Scenes
- Rosalyn: He knows I'm a pervert but trusts me anyway, can you imagine how that feels?
- Calvin: The truth is all (illegal) drugs are antidepressants.
- We have that scene where Calvin is talking to some young professional doing a fast-food job and the guy explains how much debt he's in he explains he made some bad life choice and when Calvin asks what he says "like going to college."
- Calvin: "I think we've hit a new low Hobbes..."
- At some point somebody explains Bahai's: "They're like Mormons of the middle east."
- Hobbes (as Calvin is dressing up as "queen of France"): You know a more conservative tiger might think they're something wrong with you.
Calvin: "But that tiger would miss out my my sexy armpits!" (steal from one-shot parody comic)
When Calvin gets bored and they decide to play hide and seek we see the attic for the first time.
Calvin is going to check it out but Hobbes stops him, warning him there is nothing up there for him, but Calvin is left lingering and staring at the trap door.
- At one point early in the first episode, before the conversation where Calvin says Hobbes is afraid of the house, they're playing strip poker, Calvin is winning "That's right, down to the underwear!" and Hobbes complains this is fucking ridiculous, after the somewhat serious conversation about the house Hobbes catches Calvin cheating.
(By this point we see Calvin's room is littered with energy drinks, he's still avoiding sleep.)
But what's interesting is the conversation they're having, about philosophy, which is a common topic between the two, it's far too adult a conversation for somebody Calvin's age and is similar to the conversation he has at the birthday party at the beginning of Episode 2.
While he's having the conversation during the poker game he's downing the energy drinks like crazy and starting to sputter and Hobbes says he should take it easy, he doesn't understand why Angela buys them for him.
Calvin says because Angela understands his 'plight' and Hobbes responds "It's because she knows otherwise you'll throw a fucking fit, that's why."
Perhaps Hobbes also asks how long it's been since he's slept and Calvin nonchalantly says it's day three and they disagree on what Calvin's record is.
- Maybe we introduce Margo properly when Calvin and Hobbes are 'hunting' each other with the BB gun.
Initially Calvin is hunting a 'tiger' (Hobbes) but then is surprised when Hobbes pulls out a BB gun as well and Calvin ends up stumbling into Margo's back yard when Hobbes starts shooting at him.
- In the first episode before we introduce Chance Hobbes (in the present, narrating) asks Calvin if he was afraid then.
Calvin (narrating in the present) says no, it was only when he met chance that he really became afraid.
- What if we experiment with having an 'after episode segment' during some of the psychotic arcs where Calvin directly talks to the audience (like at the end of HunterxHunter) and in one (or the only one) he goes on a list of things to do if you're being arrested, such as things to make the cops calm, talking to your lawyer.
Or perhaps it's broader to how to interact with the police in general, like always not consenting to vehicle searches or how police can and do lie all the time.
- Calvin has a peculiar way of talking where he gets excited and skips words "No, I'm always looking myself like an idiot!" He frequently switches word places too.
- Chance: Anyway, I hope I don't come off like Hitler right now
Calvin: How often do you have to ask yourself that?
- Hobbes: She talks like she’s trying to reach the minimum word count on an essay.
- Hobbes: Two PhD's and the motherfucker can't operator a projector.
- Someone who is dead or missing is described as "She loved to laugh." Calvin asks Hobbes what the hell that means, does anyone hate to laugh?
- At one point Chance casually tells Calvin Margo is trying to bury the neighbors cat in a sandbox, or maybe that's something he does.
- Calvin also has a go to statement when he wants to get out of a situation, something Hobbes taught him, similar to "I need to go return some videotapes."
- During the scene where Susie rides up on her bike, asking about Chance, Rosalyn is there with Calvin.
In the previous scene they are play-fighting with BB guns, and Calvin is talking her, Hobbes has paint on his face like he's a commando in Vietnam, but Rosalyn is also prepared, and jumps out of a tree to ambush Calvin, knocking the gun out of his hand and catching him, tickling him as he yells for her to stop.
But when Susie rolls up in the middle of this she finds it kind of creepy, and the conversation is somewhat awkward as she asks why Calvin is hanging out with a nineteen year old.
It's Susie's concern for Chance, despite outwardly hating him, that tips Calvin off that something isn't right with Chance, and we see Chance's character continue to deteriorate until he reaches a breaking point in Season 2.
- There's a scene where Calvin leaves the stuffed tiger toy on the floor.
Angela scolds him, saying that's no way to treat Hobbes, Calvin protests: "But that's how he treats me!"
- At some point Calvin and Rosalyn are walking by some abortion protesters or other religious group, one asks Calvin if he's been saved and he makes some vague reference to having saved at a checkpoint earlier, which baffles them.
As they continue walking another tells Angela that Jesus loves her and she dismisses it, saying she bets Jesus says that to all the pretty girls.
- Calvin when introducing him doing drugs talks about other drugs before dilaudid.
He says that cocaine is like how you feel when you just won a marathon.
Crack is like being first in the marathon and running past the finish line to the opposite end of the country, maybe solving poverty and world peace on the way.
(I think we're ripping that off from something, double check and don't copy verbatim.)
- Early one we show Calvin going to a scholastic book fair, showing that the time period isn't quite the present, but a weird alternative late 90s.
But at the same time Rosalyn makes references to more current events such as when she causally mentions the birth of someone she hates was "worse than 9/11."
- At some point Calvin and Rosalyn / Chance / Margo are being bored and are [hypnotizing chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_hypnotism) they always seem to be doing odd and vaguely socially destructive things when they're bored.
- At some point Calvin asks Hobbes something and Hobbes says he doesn't know, he wasn't around.
Calvin replies: "Bullshit, you’re always around."
- Calvin talks to Hobbes (locally or in narration) about not being able to get a job due to child labor laws.
He argues school is basically the same thing, he'd rather get paid for it.
- Chance (before we realize he's not Christopher) has a conversation with Calvin about how disillusioned he is with adults.
He mentions that eventually he learned about politics, thinking that at least the central system of government would be an exact science, but it’s really just hacked together like everything else.
- Building upon Rosalyn not being as deep as she thinks she is, she only has a surface level understanding of much of the ideology she subscribes to, which she uses as a way to justify her own actions, like when she explains why she's shoplifting to Calvin: "If I didn't steal your birthday gift then we'd have to purchase it, and that's just perpetuating capitalism which isn't a gift to anybody."
- Hobbes (annoyed before disappearing): I'll be waiting at home.

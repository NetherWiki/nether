**This scene takes place when the 'adventure arc' is starting to veer into more psychotic territory, the humor getting into South Park territory in terms of breaks from reality.**

*Calvin having a conversation with Rosalyn talking about how much he hates his foster father, Thomas.*

> Calvin (angry):
And he's always insulting me...

*We abruptly jump to a different scene with Calvin sitting on the couch in his home, watching TV.
Thomas steps in with a bag of Taco Bell, he gruffly throws the burrito at Calvin, hitting him in the face.*

> Calvin (squinting as he's opens the burrito):
Thanks...

*Thomas grabs his own burrito and takes a seat on the couch next to Calvin, eating it as he watches the TV.*

> Calvin (taking a bite):
You got back fast.

> Thomas (casually):
Yeah well, time flies when you're a faggot...

*Calvin stops mid-bite and just stares up (at the TV and camera and audience) in irritation.*

*We then cut back where we left off with Calvin mid-conversation with Rosalyn.*

> Calvin (getting angrier):
...it doesn't even make sense half the time!

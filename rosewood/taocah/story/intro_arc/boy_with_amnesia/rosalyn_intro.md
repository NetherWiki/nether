***When Rosalyn first comes in as his babysitter she sits down and nonchalantly asks if he has any weed.
He looks at her like she's insane and says "No...of course not."***

***Whether or not this happens in the same day as when Calvin puts away the boxes and is told by Hobbes not to visit the attic, or the next day (or some other one) will be decided later.***

*The doorbell is ringing.
It's ringing constantly, someone is very impatient, and interrupts the rings with knocks.
Calvin and Hobbes are interrupted from whatever mischief they're up to (probably the "Queen of France" conversation with Calvin dressed up serves as the segue here, so Calvin is wearing one of Angela's gowns as a costume).*

*Calvin goes up to the front door, perhaps having to lean up or stand on something to see through the peep-hole.*

> Hobbes (from the bottom of the stairs, curious at the sudden interruption):
Who is it?

> Calvin (turning back, afraid):
It's some girl!

> Hobbes:
Well, let her in.

***Dialogue is kind of weak here and needs revision.
Also when Calvin glances through the peephole.***

> Calvin:
What are you insane?
What if she's a serial killer?!

> Hobbes (frowning):
I'm sure she's perfectly safe.
She probably here for Angela or Thomas, just tell her they aren't home.

> Calvin:
You do it!

> Hobbes:
It's your house!

> Calvin:
It's not like I own the mortgage!

> Hobbes:
Why are you acting like such a wuss all of a sudden?

> Calvin:
You know I don't do well with strangers!

> Calvin (quickly glancing at the peephole and back to Hobbes):
Listen, we'll just ignore her okay?
Act like nobody's home.

> Rosalyn (behind the door, between knocks, annoyed):
Uh, hello?
I can hear shuffling around back there.
Can you open the door?

> Calvin (panicked):
Fuck!

*Hobbes rolls his eyes and strolls over, casually pushing Calvin out of the way (although the boy protests) as he opens the door a crack.
We cut to Rosalyn's perspective, a paw comes out, holding the door open just a bit, and we see a slither of Hobbes' face (the door is only widened enough to show one of his eyes).*

> Hobbes (squinting from the sunlight):
Uh...yes, can I help you?

> Rosalyn:
Are you Calvin Ferraro?

> Calvin (huddled in behind the wall adjacent to the door, panicked, to Hobbes):
What does she want?!

*Hobbes looks back at Calvin and gives him a bewildered shrug.*

> Calvin:
Well her she's got the wrong house!

> Hobbes (turning back to Rosalyn):
Uh...
No.

> Rosalyn:
No?

> Hobbes:
No.
I'm not Calvin Ferraro.
I think you must have the wrong house.

> Rosalyn (looking down at her phone):
Really?
Because the woman who hired me said I was looking for ten year old blond white male named Calvin Ferraro who lives at "3227 East Quivira Drive."

> Hobbes:
Ah, well, I think 3227 is actually the next house over.

> Rosalyn (pointing):
What about that?

*Hobbes turns his head and the numbers '3227' for the street address embedded on the front of the house right next to his head.*

> Hobbes (subtly cringing, turning back):
It's a typographical error.
Our neighbors have it too.
We get these mix ups all the time...

> Rosalyn:
Because you're not Calvin Ferraro?

> Hobbes (unconfident smile):
Exactly.

> Rosalyn:
So who are you then?

> Hobbes:
Uh...
Not...
Calvin Ferraro?

*Rosalyn pushes the door open, but instead of knocking Hobbes out of the way with a shout it is Calvin she knocks back as the pair abruptly switch positions.
Shaking off the disorientation from the sudden shift, Calvin scurries back to the cover of the stairs while Hobbes glares daggers at the intruder.*

> Rosalyn (casually shutting the door behind her as she takes a few steps into the foyer, looking around in awe):
Holy shit, this place is off the hook...

> Calvin (yelling from behind the cover of the stairs):
Hey you can't just barge in like that I'm gonna call the cops!

> Rosalyn (putting her backpack down):
To tell them what, your babysitter has arrived?

> Calvin (still behind the stairs):
Angela wouldn't hire a babysitter!

> Hobbes:
Yeah, Angela wouldn't hire a babysitter!

> Rosalyn (cocking her head as she creeps a little to the right, trying to get at an angle to see the boy behind the stairs):
I heard you the first time.
Why don't you come out from back there?
I don't bite.

*Rosalyn kneels like she's trying to coax a stray cat.
Calvin peeks his head out to steal a glance and quickly pulls back.*

> Rosalyn:
Your mom said you were shy.

> Calvin (still hidden):
She's not my mom!
And Angela wouldn't hire a babysitter!

> Rosalyn (bored of trying to get Calvin to come out, roaming through the house curiously):
I guess she didn't want you to be alone...

*As Rosalyn studies the art on the walls and flicks a few of the knick-knacks she seems completely unaware that Hobbes is also following her, staring daggers.
She roams out of sight and Calvin can hear her rummaging through the pantry.*

> Calvin (yelling):
You're not supposed to be in there!

> Rosalyn (off-camera, yelling):
Your folks must be loaded!

> Calvin (yelling):
We don't have a lot of money, and they're not my folks!

*There's no reply and Calvin can't see into the kitchen from this position on the stairs.
His curiosity getting the better of him, he creeps out, huddling behind a wall as he turns a corner to peek inside.
But the kitchen is empty.*

> Rosalyn (off-camera):
So...

*Calvin jumps back, she's behind him, holding a bottle of scotch she found.
She came back around the other way.*

> Rosalyn (cont'd):
How'd that happen?

*Calvin glances her up and down nervously, but he's out in the open now.
He notices the bottle of scotch she has and points at it.*

> Calvin:
Hey that belongs to Thomas!

> Rosalyn:
Oh, my mistake...

*Rosalyn proceed to unscrew the cap and take a shot anyway.*

> Rosalyn (wincing a bit):
"Thomas" needs to get better taste.

> Rosalyn (cont'd, turning to Calvin):
You guys got any weed?

> Calvin (nonplussed):
No...

> Rosalyn (shrugging):
Worth a shot...

*Calvin just watches in confusion as she takes another gulp of the bottle.
Hobbes is also watching with his arms crossed, somewhat impressed.*

> Hobbes:
You...haven't done this much, have you?

> Rosalyn (wiping away some tears forming in her eye, nonchalant):
I'll admit this is my first gig.
But worry not, I'm an expert on children.
I raised my mother for nineteen years.

> Rosalyn (setting the scotch on the counter, holding out her hand with a smile):
My name's Rosalyn.

> Calvin (still shy):
...Calvin.

*Calvin replies but doesn't shake hands and Rosalyn raises an eyebrow and raises her hand slightly in an inviting gesture.
Calvin makes eye contact with Hobbes before reluctantly shaking hands but as he does Rosalyn pulls his hand back to her, her other hand reaching to pull the sleeves of his shirt back, revealing the scars running across his arms (she previously only saw the tip on his palm).*

> Rosalyn (creepy grin):
Wicked!

*Calvin pulls his arm back quickly, covering it once with the shirt sleeve once-more, clearly uncomfortable.
Rosalyn just watches dispassionately.*

> Rosalyn:
Those are some mean looking scars for a kid your age.
Do the other ones go across your whole arm too?

> Hobbes (noting to Calvin):
She's observant.

> Calvin (sort of recoiling, standing his distance like someone's about to try to beat him up, reluctantly answering Rosalyn):
It was an accident...

> Rosalyn:
Is that why you don't live with your parents?
Because they cut you?

> Calvin (assertive):
Nobody cut me.

> Rosalyn (curious, flippant):
So you cut yourself then?

> Hobbes (still in the same position behind with his arms crossed, speaking on Calvin's behalf as he often does, assertive in his lower voice):
That's none of your business, Rosalyn.

*Rosalyn seems somewhat surprised by the response, but she falls silent and when she next speaks her flippant attitude has become much more serious.*

***This whole section below is pretty weak and should probably be re-worked.***

> Rosalyn:
Should I call CPS?

> Calvin (surprised):
What?
No!

> Rosalyn:
Listen kid, if somebody's hurting you...

> Calvin:
Nobody's hurting me, it was an accident a long time ago!
Just...do whatever it is you were going to do.

> Rosalyn (confused):
Like what.

> Calvin:
Whatever Angela paid you to do, I don't know.
Babysitter stuff.

**We probably have Calvin mention board games and snacks.
Rosalyn says she did bring board games so maybe she brings it up.
In any case she leaves to get it but tells Calvin he should probably get dressed.
He's still in that silly outfit he put on when playing with Hobbes, and he has the stuffed tiger toy in hand, he looks himself over.**

*We next cut to the table by the kitchen with a few establishing shots, we see the woods behind Calvin's back yard through a sliding-glass door at the opposite end of the room.
Rosalyn is leaning back in her chair, casually smoking a cigarette as she examines the chess board in front of her, we see that the smoke alarm on the ceiling above has had its battery removed.
Calvin is in another chair, his arms crossed with a brooding look.
We show that Rosalyn is actually playing against Hobbes, who lifts a piece but hesitates, thinking carefully.*

> Hobbes (putting a piece down, to Calvin):
She's good.

***This dialogue and this whole scene need to be re-worked.***

> Calvin:
She's a creep.

> Hobbes (sipping on a juice box he has):
A smart creep though.

> Calvin (being shitty):
You would say that.

> Hobbes (somewhat offended):
What is that supposed to mean?

> Rosalyn (interrupting):
Hey.

> Rosalyn (cont'd, camera cuts to her):
You gonna talk or are you just gonna stare at me passive-aggressively all day?

*The camera cuts back and we see it is now Calvin sitting in front of Rosalyn, with Hobbes having shifted positions to where Calvin was at the other seat.
Calvin quickly surveys his new position with a glance (it seems like this was intentional so it's only a passing glance) as he licks some fruit juice off his lips.*

> Calvin (making a move):
You're not supposed to be smoking that.

> Rosalyn (analyzing the board):
I didn't see a no smoking sign.

> Calvin:
It's not good for you.

> Rosalyn (moving a piece):
So I've heard...
Check!

*Rosalyn is smirking but her smile fades as Calvin quickly shifts two of the pieces with a hand.*

> Calvin (casually):
Checkmate.

> Rosalyn (leaning back, taking a puff, impressed):
You're quite skilled for someone so young.

> Calvin:
I've had a lot of practice.

**The reason Calvin says this is because when he was in the hospital he always played chess with Hobbes, a habit he continues to do as we see from an earlier scene.
For a time it was all they had to do together.**

> Rosalyn (putting the pieces back in place):
Who taught you how to play?

> Calvin (a little reluctant):
...my mom.

***I want to explain in this scene that Calvin thinks of it as 'his' house this really isn't working, there must be a better way of going about it.***

> Calvin (cont'd):
This is her house.
Well, I guess it's my house now.
I live with my aunt and uncle now, when they ran out of money, we came here.

> Rosalyn (curious, finishing re-arranging the chess board):
So she's dead?

> Calvin (quiet for a moment, then softly):
Yes.
She's dead.

> Rosalyn:
I'm sorry to hear that.
It must be tough, especially being so young.

> Rosalyn (after a beat, flippant):
So was she the one who gave you those scars?

*The camera is focused on Rosalyn but we hear the chair abruptly back up and Rosalyn looks surprised.
We cut to where Calvin was to see that Hobbes is now standing up in his place.
Calvin is now in the chair, he's glaring at her furiously, like he's about to kill her.*

*We cut back to Hobbes who is looking down with his palms on the table, like Calvin did that and then Hobbes switched in at the last moment.*

> Hobbes (looking up, calm but reserved, assertive):
I'm done playing now.


***There's a lot more left but I'm too lazy to continue working on this scene today.***


***After the conversation where Calvin explains this is his house, it was his mom's house and Rosalyn asks if she gave him those scars, Calvin says he's done playing now.***


***I'm thinking maybe whens he explains she's a babysitter she holds out a business card to him that has something comically creepy on it.
Maybe she does this when she first explains she's a babysitter, or when she introduces herself.***

***Maybe Hobbes makes some comment to the effect that Calvin's not a baby.***

***At some point she says he's pretty cute when he's not hiding / she can see his face.***

***At one point Calvin gets annoyed at her misunderstanding, asserting "This is my house!" and explaining it belonged to his mother and now it belongs to him, leading Rosalyn to ask what happened to his mom.***

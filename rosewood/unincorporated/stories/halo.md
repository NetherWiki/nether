I have a bunch of ideas regarding a re-telling of the plot of Halo (the Xbox game) but with a character who isn't a blank slate, I'll probably collect them here and eventually upload the synopsis as a Rosewood artifact.

The article notes that the book claims to be an adaptation of the video game, but seems to have taken significant liberties, including having the Arbiter there and the halo ring firing (destroying life in that section of the galaxy for which they feel guilty about).

# Unsorted Notes
- I like the idea that Cortana shares Chief's dreams when she's in the armor, even if he's still zombie-like in them, maybe she curiously taunts him inside them as she watches what he used to be.

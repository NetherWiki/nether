***After Frux's father (who is nearly feral) tells her not to come back we jump to her with Muts (separated by a cell) and she says "I think I lost my father today."***

***During this conversation when Muts defends Wrex (he just wants to protect everyone) Frux tires to explain to him that he never even mentions Muts.***

***When Frux comments about Muts being locked in a cage he abruptly opens it for her.***

***Maybe we seen that Muts has already told Wrex about his 'new friend' during a previous encounter.***

***During this scene Frux loses the book and has to quickly re-pack it, reminding the audience that she has it.***

***Muts wakes up with a dislocated shoulder, he screams when Wrex has to pop it back in place, and has a limp going forward which Serinth notes when he first meets her in Zarkhan.
It heals but Heyoke notes in the War Arc that the shoulder has always been weak, it's the same shoulder that dislocates during the moose fight in Deer Park.***

***After Wrex pops in the shoulder he hugs Muts and kind of rocks him while he cries, repeating that "Everything is okay." but we immediately cut to Frux's perspective as she looks around at how many people have died and it's very clear everything is not okay, the handful of survivors has no idea what to do next.***

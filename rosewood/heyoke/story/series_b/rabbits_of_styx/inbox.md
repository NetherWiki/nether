# Future Scenes
- In the scene with Frux and Synx having dinner, Synx specifically mentions 'thinking machines' (computers) as an impossible human invention along with others to prove her point that humanity was never real.
 - "Darkness isn’t frightening to someone who’s never seen the sun."
 - When Frux goes on the surface we describe the trees as black towers (from their perspective) that seem to reach up and hold the overlook itself (like pillars).
 Frux feels that if only she were a squirrel, she could climb them and see what those clouds hid.
 - We see that the Damned have basically become over-ranked craftsman, they're constantly called down to the lower districts just to hold things up or work on things with their paws.
As Wrex sarcastically explains to Fecs, Styx doesn't have a monopoly on violence, they have a monopoly on skilled labor.
- At one point Wrex mentions taking a cue from the wolves, the person he is talking to is somewhat shocked, "You think we have anything to learn from them?" Wrex replies "Why not? They won."
- Narse gets a letter and is told to go up to the surface, he waits in the cold and turns around, demanding to know what was so important they had to meet on the surface, but when he turns his face is frozen in horror.
He lets out a scream but only one.
And the next day his coat is found by Wrex, and we rip off The Thing sort of with the dialogue "Is it Narse?"
- We might want to re-include that library scene with Frux and Synx where Synx asks for Frux to help pick out a book, this is where Frux is given Watership Down.
Before that Frux suggests "Atlas Shrugged" and Synx says it's incomprehensible, don't bother.
Frux then suggests "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Synx says it's not what she thinks it is, Frux says she doesn't like murder mysteries anyway.
In this scene we note that Synx has already read half the books in the library and is now making her way through the Rosewater section, Frux is impressed that Synx has read so much, but Synx says there's not much else to do when you're trapped underground.
This is also where we see that locked part of the library Frux is not allowed access to, which Synx opens later in the story arc to show Frux that book on animal anatomy.
This is also the scene where Frux complains about not growing and Synx mentions that Wrex traveled the world and married twice and people still mistook him for a little boy, he hated it.
When Synx recommends Watership Down she says there are predators in it, Frux asks "Like wolves?" and Synx replies no, a 'dog', a wolf twisted by humans to serve their whims.
- During a later briefing with Narse, Wrex is stressed out about something he just had to deal with (like that ally disappearing after watching the Deadwood) and when he enters the green house he immediately goes for the pipe but Narse takes it away at the last minute, saying Wrex needs to be sober for this.
Wrex replies this is the time he least needs to be sober (or something like that but not as awkward), before Narse gives him more bad news.
- Perhaps there's an argument with Wrex and one of his subordinates about Muts, the subordinate claims that as long as Muts lives they die.
Wrex coldly responds "We'll die anyway." or something like that.

# Unsorted Notes
- I still like the idea of the cubs in Styx being assigned 'labor', like it's a coop.
- Maybe I should move the chapter title 'The Warden's Child' to when Frux actually meets Muts for the first time and instead name the first chapter 'Rabbits of Styx' since the audience won't know the name of the actual story arc.
- Don't forget Wrex's spy-pal apologizes and says he keeps forgetting Wrex's age, it's odd serving someone who is both older and younger than him.
- We should develop Fecs' character more, Wrex's faithful underling.
He tells Wrex to kill Synx and the others when he takes control, but he refuses and loses everything.
This is one reason he becomes paranoid and blood thirsty as Majordomo, he refuses to make the same mistake again, taking a lesson from Synx.
- The rabbits of Styx regularly order waves of forced sterilization on the other districts, which is about as unpleasant as it sounds.
- We may want to keep the idea that other people are tortured at the bottom of Styx, where Muts is.
Perhaps we say he used to hear crying and screaming from the other cells, but not anymore.
Or we could show that Vox is down there because he's interrogating someone, or show a scene with Wrex torturing someone then going to Muts afterwards and being very friendly, which disturbs Vox.
- Maybe change the name of the northern region from 'Alaska' to 'Valhala'.
Only the 'core' of Antioch is actually forerunner, the warren gets more and more dilapidated the further you move from the self-sustaining center.
- I like the idea that even when the rabbits are speaking English they prefer to use different words or phrases than when the wolves speak English, we should probably make a list of these differences and put it somewhere on the dev site.
- Are many of the proles drug-addicted to aether?
Can they even do that if they aren't espers?
Perhaps a very diluted variety that Styx provides to keep them in line, that's an interesting idea.

# Unsorted Notes
- I like the idea that although Serinth believes in her country Tutor educates her about the history of the republic, including some of Weston's less savory deeds, causing her to lash out in an attempt to defend her father to her teacher and herself.
- Perhaps Muts still tries to 'hop' around with an odd gate despite his overly long legs, behavior that Kae'Kil and Tutor have to correct.

# Future Scenes
- At one point Kae'Kil nods to some politicians and explains that they dye their fur to appear higher born.
They had to get surgery to even stand up on two legs because their joints wouldn't fit in the right places.
- When Heyoke first confronts Serinth about being covered in Kae'Kil's scent (and having sex with him) Serinth asks if it shocks him to which Heyoke replies "No, nothing shocks me anymore."
- When Heyoke first discovers the Rosewater archives, he stays up all night watching it.
At one point Serinth enters and tells him it's late, they have training tomorrow.
But Heyoke doesn't care, he's switching between the artifacts in awe (landing on TAOCAH), he asks her how she can't just keep watching it.
She yawns and says she's seen it all before, they all have, it's part of her history after all, they took their language from the humans.
But Heyoke asks who are these creatures (humans), where did they come from, why are they in so many worlds?
She says people have asked those questions for years, nobody has an answer.
She leaves but before stepping out completely pauses and says "Good night big brother." (Her initial irritation with him is starting to thaw.)
He replies goodnight.
- There's a scene with Heyoke accusing Kae'Kil of murdering them all (early on as they're traveling) and Kae'Kil asks who do you think helped them escape from Pylos, who do you think set up the trade treaties that kept them alive when they were on the verge of starvation?
- Kae'Kil explains that he enjoys sex, species, age, and gender are unimportant.
- As Serinth explains to Heyoke, "all our brothers and sisters were killed", nearly all of Mosphet's previous children were murdered by his enemies in a surprise attack, which is why he's hiding Serinth in Westworld and trying to restart his family lineage.
- When Muts and Kae'Kil first land and we see that scene where Kae'Kil takes out all his weapons but still keeps with, picking his teeth with it, we see Muts stop and listen to a barbershop quartet version of "In My Room" by the Beach Boys.
He's watching in awe, he's never heard music before.
Kae'Kil dismisses this, saying if he wants to listen to Rosewater properly he'll have a chance soon enough.
- At one point Muts accuses Kae'Kil of lying and he replies that he's never told a lie in his life.
- When we finally see "Cubs at Play" in Tutor's house we see it's two wolf children trying to catch a butterfly.
- At some point Heyoke and Serinth (or other characters) are talking about Wayland as they stare up as the sky and see it in the distance above the clouds, a neat scene showing how the entire world is a sphere, perhaps Serinth points out Weston, asking if he can see it, and he can just barely see the citadel.
- Muts: You're an atheist?
Kae-Kil: All foxes are atheists.
- When Heyoke catches Kae'Kil robbing a grave he replies that the dead shouldn't be burdened with such possessions.
- Tutor explains to Muts that people used to live so long, society changed very slowly.
Trends measured for hundreds of years.
Now people are born and die so quickly, culture is constantly changing, and not for the better.
- Tutor: Humans were animals that became gods, we're god's that became animals.
- In a sign of extreme trust, Kae'Kil tells Muts his original name (in Foxlish), Muts repeats it the wrong way and Kae'Kil frowns and says "Not quite."
We add a note for the audience explaining that the original name translates into "The dark star that illuminates the ignorance of the innocent" where what Muts said is roughly "The black sun that lights retarded children (on fire)".
- Kae'Kil tells Heyoke he is a regression, an esper regression, and re-explains the concept for him.

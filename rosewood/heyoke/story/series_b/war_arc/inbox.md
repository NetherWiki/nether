# Future Scenes
- I like the idea of Jagex's father having a friend on the supreme court.
He implores them to censor Mosphet, since he's leading a populist movement of fascist reform.
But this person refuses, not wanting to stifle freedom of speech, which ultimately leads to Mosphet becoming a dictator.
These are the kind of political dilemmas we want to have in this story.
I should probably read some books about the history of the world wars, like Game of Thrones is fantasy feudalism, this book is fantasy western liberal democracy.
- As we see, the way Tairon gets a lead on Weston is that a general on Tairon's side (the one who's sort of like their version of Kae'Kil) gives an order: If they see Triavox wandering by himself towards them, don't come out.
The other soldiers thinks its insane but they trick Triavox (with his seer powers) into thinking the path is safe.
- There's a point in the war arc earlier where they need to escape and Serinth gives an order to split the party between two paths.
But when Heyoke and her and a few other escape Heyoke says that maybe the others made it, one of the people in his party says no, they didn't.
Heyoke says they don't know that but then they respond "You don't get it do you?" and explain that the other party was sent down that path as bait to distract the enemy, they all died so Heyoke and the others could live.
Heyoke then confronts Serinth about this, and they have a big fight.
Serinth coldly responds they will have to continue despite this setback and Heyoke can't believe she considers the death of many of their closest allies a 'setback'.
But if Heyoke was expecting an apology from her, this was as close as she was willing to come.
Meanwhile Triavox is starting to crack under pressure, falling into bouts of psychosis, not knowing if he's in the present or future anymore.
- At one point Serinth (or someone else) resorts to burning down a forest to destroy their enemies, but Heyoke (or someone else) says they've betrayed every species they call their wards.
- At one point in this arc Serinth confides to Kae'Kil "My brother was never meant to be born in a world as cruel as this one." Kae'Kil replies that there are worse things to be born as than Mosphet's eldest son.
- I still like the idea of one of Jagex's father's assistance being a herbivore.
At one point she walks in on one of the family eating a member of her species and he apologies, she says not to, she's been around wolves for years now.
She asks if it's a kill from a recent hunt, the wolf replies yes, and this prey nearly took his eye out, "he died a noble death", and the woman says she hopes so before relaying her news.

# Unsorted Notes
- A chapter named "Whispers in the Wind" Kae-Kil says he knows something is coming but he doesn't know what.
He only sees hints, shadows, whispers in the wind.

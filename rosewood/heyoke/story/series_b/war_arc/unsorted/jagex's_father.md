***This is the flashback arc where we really see the details of Jagex's family before the war.
In this scene we see Jagex's father talking with a herbivore politician at the end of a senate session.
The herbivore's son died during one of the recent hunts, and Jagex's father is sorry for their loss.
They continue discussing and reach the conclusion that war between Weston and Tairon is inevitable, and their fear over what is happening to the country as things change around them.
We show that once upon a time The Republic of Wayland really was a function democracy.
Despite the fact that predator and prey must feed on each other when necessary, there are rules, and mutual respect on both sides.
We also really see Jagex's father's character.
(I need to come up with a name for him.)***

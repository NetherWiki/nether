# Unsorted Notes
- When the Moose breaks its neck to hit Ryzon we mention it twisted its neck in an 'obscene motion'.
After it's broken it's neck and thrown him off, it's neck is permanently stretched, the head hovering just above the hooves as it prepares to pounce again, you can see bones twisting and breaking and coming back together to create a ridge above the next, lick a second spine.
- Rather than having Heyoke wonder how long it has been since he'd seen stars when he wakes up, instead it's a comment that he's never seen stars before.

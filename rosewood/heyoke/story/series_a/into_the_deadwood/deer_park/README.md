# Deer Park
We are introduced to Serinth's pack and the terror of the Deadwood.
Heyoke is shown to have compassion for herbivores.
Serinth is shown to be emotionally distant while Jagex is shown to be deeply suspicious of her.
None of the pack seem to know why Serinth brought them to this place.
Shuik is characterized and abruptly killed, Ryzon and Pyren also receive some characterization.
A battle with a moose almost ends in disaster, but the group proceeds into the dark forest anyway.
Heyoke saves the day, but Serinth challenges him on his commitment to her mission.

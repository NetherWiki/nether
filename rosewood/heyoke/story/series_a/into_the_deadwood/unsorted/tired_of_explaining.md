***We move this to some point while they were well underway.
Probably right before the opossum attack.
Heyoke sees Serinth reading her log book.***

> Heyoke (awkwardly trying to make conversation):
Are you writing today's log?

*Serinth doesn't respond.*

> Heyoke:
I thought you weren't able to bring anything with you.

> Serinth (still reading through the book):
Not writing, reading.
I memorize them ahead of time and add them all at once.
It beats having to trek back here for each attempt.

> Heyoke (understanding):
I guess you're getting pretty tired of having to explain yourself.

> Serinth (finally looking up, flat):
Yes.
I am.

# Unsorted Notes
- We really want to think about what we show in Jagex/Pyren's flashbacks, since they overlap.
I want Pyren's flashback to really show Serinth's deterioration as she locks herself in the library.
It makes her sudden smile when she finds him looking through the books all the more creepy.

# Future Scenes
- We see Shuik comment on Jagex's relationship with Serinth: "If his tail were any lower it'd be looping through his asshole and coming out his mouth."
(Maybe this is where he mentions (jokingly) he could suck Jagex's dick, Pyren says he doesn't think Jagex is gay, Shuik offhandedly notes "he will be after I suck his dick.")
- At one point Pyren is telling Serinth a story about how someone believed he did something amazing when he didn't and now the story is spreading.
She comments that he ought to be careful, that's how religions get started.
- So at the end of this flashback, as they're getting ready to go into the Deadwood, we see Shuik tell Jagex (surprising him) that they're family and he rather likes Jagex now.
He assures Jagex that everything is going to be okay but we see Pyren's perspective and his fear for Shuik's life based on what he read in the library.
(Maybe we show this same scene in both flashbacks, but we see it from Pyren's perspective now.)
- I like the idea of showing how the younger generation is growing up much faster (because of the Rot, think about the actual ages):
	- Jagex: What are you, ten?
	- Shuik: Eight.
	- Jagex (in disbelief): No, there's no way you're under sixteen!
	- Shuik (confused): You just said I was ten.
	- Jagex: I was fucking joking!
	- (Of course Shuik actually looks and acts like an older teenager, despite whatever lower age he is, they're all aging faster now.)

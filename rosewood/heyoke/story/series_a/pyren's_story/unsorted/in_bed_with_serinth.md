***After they fuck Serinth shares a tender if not creepy moment with Pyren, telling him she's going to let him "keep his moment".
She explains to him that people think they're so in control of their lives, or at the very least, their actions and the events around them are dictated by chance.
But this isn't true, there are only a few paths one can take, and Pyren would be amazed and how far you can push things before people get off-script.
She explains to Pyren that as long as she doesn't change the main story, she can write whatever story she wants in the margins.
But Pyren doesn't understand and just thinks she's insane.***

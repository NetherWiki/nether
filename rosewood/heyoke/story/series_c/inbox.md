# Future Scenes
- When Kae'Kil introduces the idea that there might be a spy in their midst Majordomo says "Always kill a traitor before an enemy." mimicking what Synx told her in Rabbits of Styx.
- When we first introduce Kae'Kil at the piano, directly afterwards when he puts down the book we see a description of him from Majordomo, mentioning specifically 'bioluminescence' and Majordomo wondering how much aether he must take just to avoid crippling withdrawal.
We specifically mention his glowing eyes, tongue, and pawpads.
- We call the first chapter "Old Friends" based on something Kae'Kil says to Majordomo in his library when we first see them together, although as we learn they are hardly 'friends'.
Majordomo says "You've done quite well for yourself, fox."

- When they go to Tairon and Jagex finally regroups with Jaiwa she's staring at Serinth from a distance and mentions to Jagex "That woman scares the shit out of me." and Jagex replies "You have no idea..."
- After negotiations are over Jaiwa tells Jagex it seemed like Serinth knew exactly what to tell her to convince her to agree.
- When the have Majordomo imprisoned Serinth actually announces to her pack "Weston is ours."
(Or maybe she says that to Heyoke during the graveyard scene.)
- In the scene at the graveyard she tells Heyoke "Mutt" that he was the only one (originally) willing to defy Mosphet, she thinks that was brave, braver than she was.

***We have a subsection on humanity, perhaps with a quote, a creature's humanity is their intelligence, it's slowly slipping away.***

***We can have a section on feralness too, which we can link to in the main page mentioning that some animals are losing their humanity all together and becoming feral.***

***Maybe the wolves metaphorically talk about going feral as 'losing your soul', but it's just a metaphor.***

# Future Articles
- Make an article on the whole Lincoln ghost thing, add plenty of citations and use it to test citation formatting.

# Unsorted Notes
- Let's actually register the domains for RoseNET and CalvinHub and have them redirect to fake sites.
RoseNet can be a PHP-based forum that appears to have many boards and threads but requires registration to actually see any of them.
CalvinHub can be a video sharing site with a lot of other categories for art and stuff but there's no content and at the top of the page is link to a blog post by the owner explaining that CalvinHub is shutting down because he just can't deal with the legal threats anymore.
- We should probably have an article about '[kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe)' and explain how everything on the main site is presented as 'in-universe'.
- Use the term 'unfiction' with a link when describing the site on the dev page.
- Get a hold of [this person](https://suricrasia.online/unfiction/) and see if they want to contribute.
- Maybe rip this off as style for blog section: https://fwugradiation.tumblr.com/

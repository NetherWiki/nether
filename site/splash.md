**NetherWiki** is a community-edited website dedicated to cataloging esoteric phenomenon.
Our articles span a wide range of subjects--bizarre and fascinating people, objects, and events--always with a impartial and scientifically-grounded point of view.

Originally created as Foxmilk's personal blog for documenting Prototheism, the scope of the projects has expanded to catalog the many artifacts of the Rosewood Transmissions and other enigmatic phenomenon.

# Featured Article Clusters
If you just discovering NetherWiki, you may want to start with one of our main article clusters.
## [Skyshale](skyshale)
***Actually this should be about the cluster, which links to the README that links to pages like The Skyshale Documents, etc.***
[The Skyshale Documents](skyshale/the_skyshale_documents.md) refer to a collection of hand-written journal entries, photos of which were originally posted to [4chan's /x/](https://boards.4channel.org/x/) board in late 2018.
The journal entries are research notes concerning the radical manipulation of day-to-day consciousness using a combination of intense meditation and psychedelic drug use.

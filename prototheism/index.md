[todo]
Early on in the relationship to Buddhism section (or even the splash) we mention that Prototheism expands upon Buddhism, or is seen to, chasing more than just enlightenment.
In the relationship section we can specifically mention the idea of more enlightened than enlightened.

[info]
Prototheism is a diverse ideology and associated system of belief and practices.
For the purpose of this article it will be referred to as a new religious movement.
However it is important to note that some Prototheist organizations reject this label, viewing themselves as entirely secular institutions.
[/info]

Prototheism is an atheistic, rationalistic, decentralized religion based on the collective works of Azar Kianizadeh (popularly known as Skyshale).
Its adherents, known as Prototheists, believe that suffering in all its forms is the byproduct of delusional modes of thinking.
They apply rational inquiry and effective altruism to gain insight and reduce suffering for the human race and all sentient beings, a concept known as High Charity.

Prototheists believe enlightenment is a real and desirable state which can be studied empirically and induced through through the cultivation of non-dual insight.
Building upon Skyshale's research into ego-dissolution, known as Frame Theory, Prototheists combine modern meditative techniques with psychoactive catalysts in order to enter and explore non-ordinary states of consciousness.
Through the development of metacognitive awareness in these altered states Prototheists learn to recognize and correct various non-conceptual biases and systemic distortions inherent in human perception, such as the belief in an enduring independent self.

Prototheism was developed through Skyshale's various notebook entries, specifically her two incomplete manuscripts: The Mantle and The Standard Framework.
The first formal Prototheist collective was formed shortly after her death.
Prototheism gained mainstream attention after Skyshale's notebooks were leaked to 4chan's /x/ board.
Prototheism now enjoys a healthily growing following.
Prominent collectives like Vanilla have attracted criticism for their wealth and influence.
As a new rapidly growing religion Prototheism is associated with many conspiracy theories, such as it being a front for a New World Order.

# Worldview
[todo]
I think on the rewrite we can move a lot of the details here down to the Teks section and make the first Tek on enlightenment or non-dual understanding (maybe rip off doors of perception's language?).
[/todo]

## Rationality
[todo]
In the rewrite let's mention that Prototheists believe that humans have blind spots in their rationality that need to be corrected, and these blind spots are both conceptual and non-conceptual biases.
[/todo]

Prototheism is described as a rational religion and as humanistic and nihilistic.
Prototheists believe that in the existence of an objective shared reality that is knowable through science and reject the supernatural, including the existence of a personal God.
They seek to extinguish all forms of delusion through education, including non-conceptual delusions.
They believe that absence of evidence implies evidence of absence and embrace [Bayesianism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AN2cBr6xKWCB8dRQG/what-is-bayesianism).

Skyshale believed that most of the interesting problems in philosophy had already been resolved by science and designed her religion to amend itself based on empirical observations about reality.

Prototheists are moral relativists and embrace the doctrine of dependent origination they do not believe in free will as it is seen to require an enduring form of self that does not exist.
Free will as a sociological construct is still seen as a useful invention, used to establish informed consent or culpability between two parties.
But human beings, like other animals, are seen as biological machines and are not responsible for their own actions.
Thus there is no concept of sin in Prototheism.

Prototheists view the universe as devoid or objective morality or meaning.
Even the desire to end suffering is seen as an arbitrary choice caused by the root delusion, although a delusion that all living beings agree on.
Prototheism rejects moral absolutism, stating that morality is a construct of society and that its development can be explained through the lens of evolutionary biology.

Prototheism is a religion dedicated to the elimination of suffering and sees all other doctrine is seen as subordinate to this goal.
Rationality is not value for its own sake only as the most effective known tool for the mass implementation of High Charity.
Elements of Prototheist doctrine, such as advocacy of human rights and universal compassion for all sentient beings are not taught because they are 'good' or 'moral' but because they are rational conclusions of those who wish to eliminate suffering.
Concepts like vengeance or greed are not rejected because they are 'wrong', but because simply because they are seen as nonsensical.

Prototheists are encouraged (and frequently expected) to remain skeptical and challenge the validity of any belief they deem lacking in sufficient empirical evidence including core Prototheist doctrine.
Prototheism was designed to be as practical and intuitive as possible and great importance is placed on the practicality of Prototheist beliefs, ideology that isn't practical is not useful and should be discarded.
In general however all Prototheist ideology is seen as advisory.
Certain actions are likely to cause suffering and should generally be avoided.
Evil or cruel actions are seen to derive from ignorance (including ignorance of non-dual insight) or malfunction (due to mental illness).

As morality is subjective and constructed by society there appears to be little reason to follow laws one disagrees with.
Prototheism is associated with the use of entheogens, including controlled substances such as LSD and DMT.
Prototheist collectives like the Cult of Dead Fox reject the notion of intellectual property and encourage piracy.

## Suffering
Like Buddhism, Prototheism is founded on the elimination of suffering (or dukkha).
All suffering is believed to originate from delusion, even if one is being burnt alive, and that this delusion takes the form of wanting things to be different than they are.
Because of delusions spawned as byproducts from the evolutionary process, humans wish the universe to be different than how it is.
Prototheists focus on the practical elimination of suffering through changing the universe to conform to one's wishes and changing one's wishes to conform to the universe.
Ultimately Prototheists seek to correct the inherent biases (such as the belief in an independent self) that cause craving and aversion in order to find happiness.

### Inherent bias
[todo]
Maybe mention the black notebook and the idea that Prototheism leads to suicide if taken too far (further than Buddhism).
[/todo]

Prototheists make a distinction between ordinary suffering and existential suffering.
While ordinary suffering such as the loss of a loved one, sickness, or the desire for wealth can be addressed through practical skills (grieving, medicine, a better job), existential suffering (the inherit restlessness all human begins feel in their moment to moment existence) can only be addressed through the correction of non-conceptual delusions via repeated exposure to altered states of consciousness.

All humans share a series of cognitive distortions spots as a byproduct of their evolution as organisms.
This is known as inherent bias or anthropomorphic bias.
Like mental 'blind spots', these distortions cause people to chase after temporary experiences that will never lead to lasting happiness.
These distortions are the side-effect of the development and recognition of the 'self'.
Lower organisms live in a world of instinct, but higher organisms, like humans, are capable of self-reflection, this realization of the self causes much existential suffering as humans try to answer questions like 'Why do I exist?' or 'What happens after I die?'

However the nature of the self itself is misunderstood on a fundamental level.
For example, all humans wish to avoid death, but there is no logical reason to believe being alive is better than being dead.
This is known as the root delusion, the delusion from which all suffering arises, the idea that there is a self separate from the rest of the universe that must be defended.

### Liberation
The self and the delusions that spawn from it, can be corrected through recognition of the three characteristics or marks of existence.
However these marks of existence cannot be understood through armchair philosophy but must be deeply realized on an unconscious level.
This sort of knowledge, the knowledge associated with 'enlightenment' is non-conceptual in nature.
The easiest way to obtain this knowledge is through the development of metacognitive awareness through various Prototheist Teks.
The partial realizations of these fundamental truths is known as a insight experience.
The experience of ego dissolution which follows sufficient development of metacognitive awareness is known as Nimp, a nonsense word coined by Skyshale to avoid the ambiguities of 'ego death'.
The framework for understanding and exploring these altered states is known as Frame Theory.

## High Charity
High Charity is the ultimate goal of Prototheism.
It refers to a hypothetical world with an absence of suffering as well as the work a Prototheist performs in order to advance that goal.
The concept of High Charity is somewhat ambiguous with varying interpretations across the major Prototheist schools.

High Charity usually takes the form of of public research, charity donations, or some other public good.
Reducing suffering in oneself is also seen as valid High Charity work, especially through the cultivation of non-dual insight.

# Relationship to Buddhism
Prototheism is popularly compared to a secular offshoot of Buddhism or a successor to Buddhism or is said to 'inherit' much of its core doctrine.
However this is not entirely correct.
Skyshale independently discovered many core Buddhist concepts before she was familiar with Buddhism through her experience with psychedelic drugs.

Although Prototheists and Buddhists share many of the same terminology they are separate religions.
The concept of karma, past lives, and other concepts that are incompatible with science are rejected.

The concept of anattā,is expanded upon and recontextualized in a framework of delusion.
The three marks of existence are embraced and considered to be empirically verifiable facts.

Skyshale heavily criticized what she considered the commodification of Buddhism as a popular religion since most lay Buddhists have not intention of gaining enlightenment.

Skyshale also criticized mainstream Buddhist schools for not embracing modern technology and academic inquiry, specifically the use of psychoactive substances to realize the three characteristics.
While a Buddhist monk may spend decades of daily practice to reach enlightenment, Prototheists typically finish a vipassanā cycle within a year of semi-regular practice.

# Structure
Prototheism is structured into multiple semi-autonomous sects, frequently formalized into Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.
These Prototheist collectives have the authority to reinterpret non-core aspects of Prototheist doctrine as they see fit.
Prototheism is a federated group, with a collective-elected 'superstructure' that deals with inter-collective conflict and collaboration.
Organs of this superstructure include the Single Prototheist Working Community, ArbCom, and C-Sec.

# Extant Prototheist groups
## Vanilla Corporation
Vanilla Corporation is the largest and oldest Prototheist collective.
Founded by Skyshale's wife shortly after her death, Vanilla is intended to be a reference implementation for Prototheist ideology.
The organization retains a major transhumanist slant with major grants going out to organizations like Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the OpenCog Foundation, and the SENS Research Foundation.
Vanilla's stated goal is to bring about a technological singularity in order to usher in a new era of High Charity.

## Cult of the Dead Fox
The Cult of the Dead Fox, founded by Kenrick Valler after a schism that led to the formation of Vanilla, is the second oldest Prototheist collective.
CDF believes in achieving High Charity through anonymous grassroots charitable work and achieving personal enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.

Formed as a cross between a housing coop and a meditation center, CDF adherents live communally is tenant-owned buildings.
By day they meditate to gain insight into ultimate reality and by night they engage in what has been referred to as "guerrilla charity work".
Examples include cleaning up litter or donating food, always without taking credit.
Adherents normally spend up to four hours meditating during the day in a monastery-like atmosphere.
A common in-joke is that there are no casual cultists.

## Nouveau
Nouveau is a non-public Prototheist sect that seeks High Charity through the mass-availability of psychedelic substances.
To this end they have become one of the largest distributors of controlled substances on the deep web.
They also supply tools for biohacking such as custom DNA plasmids.

## Solar Doctrine
The Solar Doctrine is an independent Prototheist group that originated from MLP-based image boards in the aftermath of the popularization of the docs on 4chan's /x/ board.
They place an emphasis on tulpamancy and developing other Prototheist Teks.

# Prototheist Teks
Prototheism is a religion based upon the knowledge gained through exploration of altered forms of consciousness.
This exploration takes the form of 'Teks', a pun on 'techniques', which are protocols for enter and exiting these altered states.
These Teks can take the form of 1000 year-old meditation instructions, such as various forms of vipassanā.
But they're mostly modern techniques, developed through large-scale clinical testing to maximize results and combined with controlled dosages of specific psychoactive substances, known as catalysts.

## Lucid dreaming
Lucid dreaming was Skyshale's initial foray into altered states.
Prototheism has enjoyed regular popularity in lucid dreaming communities.
Groups like the lucid dreaming subreddit benefit from research by Prototheist groups (like Vanilla) that seek to enhance community-developed lucid dreaming techniques like Wake-Back-To-Bed.

# Criticism
A major criticism of Prototheism is that the religion is not complete.
The Mantle was under heavy revision at the time of Skyshale's death and The Standard Framework ends in the middle of a chapter.

Skyshale rarely referred to Prototheism by name during its development and some believe the project was little more than a hobby for her.
It is likely the Prototheism she envisioned was quite different than modern Prototheism.

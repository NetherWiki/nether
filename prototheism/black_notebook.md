The black notebook was Skyshale's final journal, which she kept prior to her suicide.
The first half of the notebook also serves as a suicide note, filled with personal letters to her friends and family as well as plans for redistribution of her property.
The second half describes the reasoning behing her suicide.
In her finaly essay Skyshale layouts in detail how she came to the understanding that staying alive is inherently an incorrect choice.
Once the root delusion is completely vaquished suicide is an inevitable outcome.

The notebook is notorious for its content.
As a prelude to her final essay Skyshale warned that the notebook could become a blight on humanity if it were ever copied to the internet.
The arguments in the notebook have proven to be so convincing that those who read it frequently commit copycat suicides.
This has proven to be such a problem that all extant copies of the black notebook have been declared destroyed, publically at least.
Although it is widely suspected that both Tsukitei Endo and Kenrick Valler retain copies.

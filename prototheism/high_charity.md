In Prototheism High Charity is a multi-faceted and somewhat ambigious concept which refers to both a hypothetical world without suffering as well as the work a Prototheist does to further that aim.
High Charity is the ultimate goal of Prototheism, although the concept is abstract with various Prototheist collectives interpreting it in their own way.

All Prototheists are expected to contribute to High Charity in some way and gain rapport by doing so.
Contributing to one's own happiness is also considered valid High Charity work.

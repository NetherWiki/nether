Prototheist teks (short for techniques) are protocols for entering and navigating altered states of conciousness.
Teks can be thought of as specialized forms of meditation, frequently combined with [psychoactive catalysts](catalyst.md).
Many tkes are based upon [Skyshale's research](frame_theory.md) and are now developed by the community.
Teks are considered an important part of the Prototheist religion as Prototheists believe exposure to altered states of consciousness is a prerequisite to overcoming [inherent bias](inherent_bias.md).

# History
[todo]
We have a quote by Skyshale criticizing the Buddhism in academia as having lost sight of its goal.
She says to hold a PhD in Buddhsim you have to become an expert in history.
But shouldn't a PhD in Buddhism require you to become an [arhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat)?

Teks are based upon Skyshale's early attempts at optimizing vipassana meditation.
Vipassana meditation is the form of meditation buddhists practice to become enlightened.
Vipassana typically takes many months of intense meditation in the form of slowly 'stretching' one's perception of sensory stimuli through repeated mental exercises.
After sufficient [metacognitive awareness](frame_theory.md#Metacognitive_awareness) has been developed the mind as a whole is seen to be merely a collection of unconscious heuristics trading sensory information with each other mechancially and a seaparate sense of [self](self.md) can no longer be maintained, leading to an [insight experience](non-dual_insight.md#insight_experience.md).

Skyshale realized the difficulty and time requirements of vipassana meditation stifled mass-adoption of the technique (and therefore enlightenment of the masses).
She knew that certain modern techniques (such as Mahasi Noting) have proven to be particularly effective compared to previous forms of vipassana.
She also knew that psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, could spontaneously trigger ego death, albeit the insight gained from such experiences tended to be transitory.

Skyshale was interested in further refining vipassana, constructing a theoretical framework for describing insight experiences with scientific rigor.
She believed appropriate dosages of psychedlic drugs could act as mental steriods that accelerated the [progress of insight](non-dual_insight.md#progress_of_insight).
She envisioned a technique developed by cognitive psychologists and taught as a course in universities that could be mastered in a semester or two.

The nature of the [Zebulon Protocol](zebulon_protocol.md) has been refined over time and other teks have been formalized as well.
[Lambda](lambda.md) continues to perform wide ranging clinical studies, mostly funded by [Vanilla](vanilla.md).

# Examples
## Zebulon Protocol
The Zebulon Protocol is the first formalized Prototheist Tek and the flaship product of the Single Prototheist Working Committe and Lambda.

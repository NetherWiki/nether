Vanilla Corporation is a Prototheist collective founded by Tsukitei Endo.
It is the older and largest Prototheist collective by total membership.
Vanilla takes its namesake as the 'reference' implementation of Prototheism and the first post-sectarian collective.
This is reflected in their solgan "Prototheism for everyone."
Vanilla was purported created to match Skyshale's original vision for Ptotheism as closely as possible.
From the organization's website, their self-proclaimed goal is to "Employ widespread collaboration in order to implement massively-philanthropic goals."

Vanilla beleives in achieving High Charity through effective altruism and the skillful use of technology.
Taking a rationalist approach embraced by the likes of the Bill and Milenda Gates foundations, Vanilla uses scientific research to direct develop charities that maximize the collective welfare of humanity.

One of the major research areas of Vanilla is AI, as the organization wishes to eventually kick-start a technological singularity.


# Net Worth
Vanilla Corporation is the wealtheist Prototheist collective in existence.

Many early ethereum developers were members of Vanilla and CDF.

Other soruces of income include patents, especially machine learning related patents.
Examples include a corporate robot that flips garbage into the air and uses object recognition and a pellet gun to quickly sort it.


# Membership requirements
Membership in Vanilla Corporation (as opposed to associateship) is widely coveted.
Unlike most Prototheist sects Vanilla has very stringent membership requirements, including a yearly review of one's past charitable work which many have compared to defending a disseration.
Benefits of membership include voting rights for control of the board of directors and access to Vanilla's research resources.
Members receive a stipend that covers food, housing, and travel, allowing them to work on their research full-time.
Vanilla also provides a pension for long-term members and a 1-to-1 401K match.

Membership at Vanilla has proven so beneficial that even researchers who have no interest in Prototheism have joined.
It is common to become a member long enough to obtain a pension, and then to leave the organization.
As doing so ensure one never needs to work for the rest of their life.

# Research
## Psychonautic research
Vanilla funds the largest clinical meditation studies to date.
These studies are used as evidence for working committees that wish to amend the meditation protocols of the Core Prototheist Specification.

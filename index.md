Welcome to NetherWiki!

NetherWiki is my personal blog, where I can write articles about things that interest me.
It's an idea that has been tumbling around head for the last half-decade or so.

I don't have much to say myself.
I've never been personally very creative.
But I have always been fascinated by the fringe.
Over the years I've learned about a lot of bizarre, unexplainable or just generally esoteric event and objects and people.
I guess it's sort of my hobby.

So I hope you enjoy this site.
There's not a lot on it right now, but I'm currently working on some articles about Skyshale and the history of Prototheism.
And yes, I'm afraid this yet another Prototheist blog.
Please feel free to share your constructive feedback, even if it's negative.
I have a thick skin after all.<sup><strike>No, not really.</strike></sup>

Oh, also we have a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/YHamcAUksB) now! For some reason...

## Featured Article Clusters
### The Rosewood Transmissions
[The Rosewood Transmissions](rosewood) are a series of ongoing radio transmissions originating out of the Travis Country area.
These transmissions take the form of analog and digital signals encompassing audio recordings, binary data, news programs, television shows, music, literature, movies, and miscellaneous conversation--the vast majority of which have never been found outside of the transmissions themselves.

The NetherWiki community was founded to document the thousands of hours of media composing these Rosewood artifacts.
Some of our most popular articles include [Heyoke the Wolf](rosewood/heyoke/) and [TAOCAH](rosewood/taocah).

### The Skyshale Documents
The Skyshale Documents refer to a collection of hand-written journal entries, photos of which were originally posted on 4chan's /x/ board in 2014.
The journals contain [spoiler]research notes concerning the study and manipulation of conscious perception through a combination of meditation and psychoactive drug use.
As well as various notes and essays on topics including experimental decentralized political systems, world religion, AGI development, and the nature of the self.[/spoiler]



The journals have received widespread attention to their erudite and esoteric nature.
Skyshale outlines several techniques for radically augmenting consciousness, including the formation of separate sentient personalities, the induction of photo-realistic hallucinations at will, full control or even abolition of human emotion, and a procedure for achieving classical Buddhist enlightenment.
A series of new religious movements have sprung up around Skyshale and her writing known as Prototheism.
